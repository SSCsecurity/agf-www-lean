            <description>The economic recovery from last year’s pandemic-induced recession gained more steam during the first half of 2021, but given the sheer strength of the rebound in countries like the United States where lockdowns seem like a thing of the past, inflationary fears have now come to the fore and may play the biggest role in determining the outcome of both equity and bond markets going forward.</description>

            <description>This paper highlights the importance of shareholder engagement in Emerging Markets where environmental, social and governance (ESG) data is sparse. We review third-party ESG rating agencies' role in advancing ESG investing globally but highlight caution in basing investment decisions on ratings alone. We have found limitations and inherent biases behind the analysis and ratings, including the lack of quality ESG data and the comparability between rating agencies. We thus conclude ESG integration with active shareholder engagement is more vital to understanding and analyzing a company’s ESG issues.</description>

            <description>The U.S. Federal Reserve says it wants to let inflation run “hot.” But will the central bank get the chance to prove it?
