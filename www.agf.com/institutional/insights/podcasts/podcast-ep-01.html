<td width="80%">[Music] Investors often consider emerging markets a singular thing, an it, not a they, but that doesn&#8217;t do nearly enough justice to one of the most diverse investment themes out there. On this episode of the podcast, Kevin McCreadie, AGF CEO and Chief Investment Officer is joined by Regina Chi, Leader Portfolio Manager of AGF&#8217;s Emerging Market Equity Strategies, to discuss the opportunities and risks of investing in the developing world today.</td>

<td width="10%">00:01:29</td>
<td width="10%">KM</td>
<td width="80%">So, the last 2.5 years it&#8217;s been, the main difference versus the previous business cycles, is really the trade wars. And it&#8217;s not only impacted emerging markets, but it&#8217;s also impacted global markets in general. And that has been the key differentiator in terms of making considerations when you construct your portfolio, as well as picking stocks. And, as you know, the trade wars have been initiated by the US. That&#8217;s caused enormous amount of uncertainty.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%">00:02:01</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">And it&#8217;s not&#8230; It just hasn&#8217;t impacted emerging markets. It&#8217;s impacted developed markets as well, including Europe as well as Japan. So, that&#8217;s definitely increased the risk premiums for markets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="10%">DP</td>
<td width="80%">And then, Kevin, from your perspective, how important have emerging markets become to the investment world?</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%">00:02:27</td>
<td width="10%">KM</td>
<td width="80%">I&#8217;d go back to probably the mid-90s was really where the EM market really, in my mind, saw both the good and bad of what investor appetites were, right. You had the crisis in Thailand in &#8217;97, and it really burned, maybe, in some people&#8217;s minds that, jeez, these really legitimate countries or developed markets, or had the liquidity. And I think that misnomer still even 20-odd years later, is still there for some investors.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%">00:02:58</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">And it&#8217;s actually not the same set of countries or dynamics behind EM today as then, but yet I feel some investor&#8217;s pain in the same. That it&#8217;s a more volatile asset class that is subject to these currency crises, these crises that manifest themselves in these equity heartbreaks. And I actually look at where they are today. They probably have the makeup of them from an investor standpoint, it&#8217;s probably more appealing and robust than some of the developed markets that we invest in.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%">00:03:32</td>
<td width="10%">RC</td>
<td width="80%">Yes, so that&#8217;s a good point, Kevin, and if I set back, yes, the 2.5 years we&#8217;ve been impacted by trade uncertainty, but if you look beyond that, the last five years, there&#8217;s been enormous change in the evolution of emerging markets. And it&#8217;s mainly, the biggest change really happened in 2017 with the onset of digitalisation, and the digitalisation has allowed for a very strong pace of innovation, particularly in China.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%">00:04:01</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">And to Kevin&#8217;s point, emerging markets used to be a commodity play where you had a third of the index in energy materials, and that has dropped significantly. And now, what&#8217;s replaced that is information technology or technology in general, where that makes up over 30%. And so that&#8217;s a huge positive structural change that&#8217;s happened in the last five, six years.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%">00:04:26</td>
<td width="10%">KM</td>
<td width="80%">Yes, and I think it&#8217;s also the diversity of the sector makeup. To Regina&#8217;s point, it&#8217;s not the dominance tech that was non-existent 20-odd years ago, with a handful of a few countries and a few companies. But it&#8217;s the breadth of them, and it&#8217;s the middle-class-ation of those countries, as they all aspire to move up the chain. They demand more from healthcare systems, pharmaceuticals, consumer retail, consumer staples. And so, they look, on the surface, very different than they did 20 years ago.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%">00:04:56</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">So, as an asset class, I think it&#8217;s something that is still a little bit misunderstood, but probably has some great opportunity, given some of the dynamics that are underneath those countries specifically.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="10%">RC</td>
<td width="80%">Yes, and one thing that most investors don&#8217;t appreciate is the fact that emerging markets have been able to leapfrog developed markets at such a fast pace, because of the fact that they don&#8217;t have these heavy legacy businesses or technologies that&#8217;s keeping them down.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%">00:05:27</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">They&#8217;ve been able to bypass bank terminals or bank branches, because they have been able to do Alipay or Tenpay through their phones. And as well as bypassing PCs altogether, because they&#8217;re looking online with their smart phones, and so leapfrogging is a very big theme that&#8217;s benefitted emerging markets.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="10%">KM</td>
<td width="80%">And even if you go back into the early parts of the last decade, the adoption curve for phones, didn&#8217;t start with a wired phone system.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%">00:05:58</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">It leapt right through cell phones and the idea of a cable, wired cable house to bring you TV has been jumped into streaming. So, I think there are whole ways that we look at those markets and say that they won&#8217;t even adopt heavy infrastructure, like the developed world did for some of these things.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="10%">DP</td>
<td width="80%">Kevin, you mentioned that some investors might have a misunderstanding about merging markets still. How does that manifest itself?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%">00:06:27</td>
<td width="10%">KM</td>
<td width="80%">So, every time we see an event on the news, whether it be some of the events in Latin America this year, with Venezuela, Argentina, even now Bolivia. People immediately react to, this is just like it was two decades ago. And the reality is, EM is a pretty deep place to invest, in terms of number of countries today, it&#8217;s 26. Probably back in the 90s, you&#8217;re probably dealing with half that number. So, again, you have more choices. You don&#8217;t have to invest in those countries.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%">00:06:54</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">So, I think the investor mentality still harkens back to a very different looking, and not valid, set of countries today, that versus where they were in the 90s, when some of those things were problematic. They still are problematic at a country level, but I think that you have a pretty broad place to be able to fish, to be able to get rid of some of that negative effect, if you wanted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="10%">RC</td>
<td width="80%">Yes, I&#8217;ve always said that emerging markets is not a homogeneous zone. And I like to say that you can&#8217;t buy a plane ticket to emerging markets or to EM.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td width="10%">00:07:28</td>
<td width="10%"></td>
<td width="80%">There are 26 countries, as Kevin mentioned, and each of those regions, whether that&#8217;s Latin America, Asia, Eastern Europe, they&#8217;re all generating different rates of growth, different CPI. And so that gives us the opportunity of stock picking across different regions and sectors. And we believe that emerging markets is incredibly cheap right now, trading near close to a 30% discount to developed markets, where the growth rate is 2.5 times higher than developed markets.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="10%">00:08:02</td>
<td width="10%">KM</td>
<td width="80%">Yes, growth rates, I think, in the end this year are probably going to be still north of four, and the developed markets, with the malaise in Europe right now, and the slow down that we&#8217;re seeing in the US. If you put the developed markets together, they may be one in change. So again, very dramatic difference in their growth rates. But I&#8217;ll come back to something else you said about the 26 countries, and I think this is where it pays to be truly active, to be able to make specific country decisions, versus where you would end access and have to own some of those problems.</td>

</td>
<td width="80%">Some of those countries you wouldn&#8217;t want to invest in. If you&#8217;re buying in, you&#8217;re actually going to have to own them, whereas we can make truly active decisions based upon our knowledge about where to pick and choose to make those investments. But I do think it&#8217;s the breadth of those that you have that&#8217;s different today. And I think there&#8217;s, as Regina said, I think the growth rates look pretty good, relative to what you can buy in the developed world today, at multiples that we haven&#8217;t seen in the developed world for quite some time.</td>

<p><span>RC</span></p>
</td>
<td width="80%">If I can add to that, we fundamentally believe that country matters in emerging market, and picking the right country stock market is important, so that you can avoid country markets like Argentina where you&#8217;ve had a huge blow up in the Argentina peso, as well as Venezuela. And so ultimately, we&#8217;re trying to buy countries that will be relative outperformers, by having a disciplined process with that country allocation framework.</td>

India&#8217;s about 8% of the index and South Korea is a double-digit exposure as well. So, we believe we know Asia well, particularly China, and to that end, this China trade war has been a detractor for its own economy, but also for global economy.</td>

</td>
<td width="80%">So, as China has weakened, it&#8217;s had some impact to those economies and those markets, and that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve seen reflected in the lag on EM this year, relative to some of the developed indices market returns. I think if you go back to it though, China is still probably the largest source of growth, for a country its size, in the world. It&#8217;s the number two economy, that&#8217;s growing 6%. Just think about the absolute amount of growth, not in percentage terms, but dollar terms, that represents in a given year.</td>

They don&#8217;t know what the rules are going to be around which goods are going to be tariffed and when. They pull back, and that uncertainty starts to create market dislocations, as we&#8217;ve seen throughout the year.

As we sit here today, in mid-November, late-November-ish, it looks like there&#8217;s be a trade truce for sure, of some sort. Meaning some of the tariffs get pulled back, some amount of agricultural goods will be purchased, but not sure you really get the, what was once envisioned, a full two part trade deal which deals with the bigger, longer term issue, as China does develop at this pace.</td>
