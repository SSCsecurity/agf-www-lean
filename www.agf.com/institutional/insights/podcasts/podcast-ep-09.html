<td valign="top">Sustainable investing continues to come of age in 2020, but in a year marked by the harrowing effects of a global pandemic and growing social unrest, our definition of what it takes it invest responsibly may be forever changed. On this episode of Inside Perspectives, Kevin McCreadie, AGF CEO and Chief Investment Officer is joined by AGF Portfolio Manager, Martin Grosskopf, and Judy Goldring, AGF&#8217;s president and head of global distribution, to discuss the landscape for sustainable investing moving forward.</td>

<td valign="top">00:00:34</td>
<td valign="top">DP</td>
<td valign="top">I&#8217;m your host, David Pett. Let&#8217;s get into it. Welcome, Kevin, Judy and Martin. Thanks for being here today. Judy, you&#8217;ve done this before. Martin, you haven&#8217;t done this before. So, thanks for joining us. I think it&#8217;s safe to say the pandemic has changed the way all of us think about the world over the past few months, and how we go about our daily lives.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:01:01</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">But what has it meant for sustainable investing? That&#8217;s what I want to talk about today. Over the past few years, environmental, social and governance factors, or ESG for short, have become much more ingrained in the decisions that investors make about their portfolios. Has the past few months solidified ESG&#8217;s importance, or has it sidetracked this momentum, given everything else that investors are being forced to contemplate? Kevin, maybe I&#8217;ll just start with you on that. Any thoughts?</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">KM</td>
<td valign="top">You know Dave, I don&#8217;t know, I think it&#8217;s brought a greater awareness, frankly, to these issues.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:01:29</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">And I say that in the theme of, I think when the world stopped, as we moved into the shutdown, people looked around and noticed that there weren&#8217;t that many cars on the street. Friends comment in California that they hadn&#8217;t seen the skies that blue in so long. And so, I think you created an awareness for many people visually because of it. And I think the second thing was we all had time to slow down and look around and think about some of these issues. I think that we immediately felt an impact of it. Then I transition to, maybe away from that component of it, but the other letters in ESG, which are the S and the G.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:02:00</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">They kind of blur here a little bit on the next issue, which is really around how companies handle keeping their workforce safe and healthy throughout this. How they prioritise getting employees home, getting them out of harm&#8217;s way from the virus, and how to help them through this in terms of the family situations that they all felt. So, I think we&#8217;ll look back at that and say, that trend is going to be something we&#8217;ll think about, look at, and review how companies handled it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:02:25</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">I don&#8217;t know that it has diminished anything. If anything, it&#8217;s heightened the awareness on a lot of fronts.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">JG</td>
<td valign="top">Yes, and actually David, if I could pipe in as well, I think the G part of ESG certainly has much greater height and attention to so many social issues, given the social unrest in the United States in particular. So, I think it&#8217;s an interesting time that we are really looking at proper governance, we&#8217;re looking at oversight, we&#8217;re looking at ensuring people have voices around the table. So, it is a time of real change from that perspective too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">DP</td>
<td valign="top">And then Martin, what&#8217;s your thought on this, as someone who is actively investing in the sustainable space, how have you seen the last few months play out from an ESG or sustainable standpoint?</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:03:00</td>
<td valign="top">MG</td>
<td valign="top">Well, I think we need to recognize it&#8217;s within or through a progression in the financial markets of integrating ESG for 20 years. So really, it&#8217;s picked up dramatically even prior to the present crisis. But I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s a number of factors related to COVID that I think are waking people up a little bit, especially around the dynamic between health and environment. This is clearly something that environmental scientists had been flagging for years, and markets weren&#8217;t paying attention to it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:03:30</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">But the potential for a global pandemic was pretty well written about, at least in the academic community. So, I think there&#8217;s now a much broader that poverty, environment, health, that there&#8217;s relationships between those, and that the financial markets have an important role to play. And especially when we&#8217;re 12 trillion into stimulus, you hope some of that stimulus is directly at actually solving the problem as opposed to just putting a Band-Aid on the issue and getting us to the next potential pandemic or significant environmental risk.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:04:02</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">I think there is a general recognition that there&#8217;s secular trends, and more capital needs to flow to solve some of these issues. They can&#8217;t be ignored. They&#8217;re not just marginal issues, they have a tremendous impact on financial projections and capital. So, I think that is something that COVID has really brought to the floor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">DP</td>
<td valign="top">And maybe that&#8217;s a good stepping off point, to talk a little bit about the political landscape that we&#8217;ve seen unfold over the last few months, with respect to some of the massive stimulus that we&#8217;ve seen.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:04:29</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">There&#8217;s a sense that a lot of that stimulus is being targeted now towards ESG initiatives or factors. Do you see that continuing to be the case, and does this represent a sea change in terms of how governments engage with the sustainable side of things?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">MG</td>
<td valign="top">I do think that, as you said, it&#8217;s targeted. If you look at the Canadian government, rather than single out specific industries, what they basically said is, we need to help the energy sector, it&#8217;s important to Canada, but let&#8217;s help in a way that helps the environment too.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:05:00</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">Let&#8217;s clean up some of the problems that have been out there environmentally, put money to work there, keep people employed while we&#8217;re going through this patch and the softness. I think that there are places where governments have tried to target it. I&#8217;ve seen it in a couple of other places in Canada, but I think there&#8217;s more to be done there. We&#8217;re going to be in this a lot longer, and so probably until somewhere into next summer, maybe at the earliest before we get to a level of an inoculated population around the world, where people can get economic activity back to what we knew was normal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:05:31</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">And so, I think between now and then, there will be opportunities to try to put money to work to further some of these initiatives. I think a lot of it is going to be not just about the environment sustainable issues, it&#8217;s also going to be about, back to the social issue. How do we make sure people aren&#8217;t being, again, forced out of the system, because they&#8217;ve not been able to work while the virus has gone on, and how they would not have gone into bankruptcy, how it would not further the inequality issues that out there. And so, I think there is going to be a greater component of this, certainly as we move forward in time, because it&#8217;s going to take longer.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:06:01</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">Some of those issues will be addressed probably more forcefully by governments, in this again, growing deficit issue that we&#8217;ll face around the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">DP</td>
<td valign="top">And let&#8217;s break that down a little bit more from a corporate perspective, and Judy, maybe I can get you to weigh in here. But when we think of E and the S and the G, it seems to me that a lot of the focus in the past has been on the E part of it. Going forward, do you think that there will be more focus on the S and the G part of things, given what we&#8217;ve seen in the US with the protests, and things of that nature?</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:06:32</td>
<td valign="top">JG</td>
<td valign="top">Yes, definitely. I think in the past, most recently what we&#8217;ve been seeing is a disproportionate impact of the pandemic on women in particular. Women are being forced out of the workplace at record numbers. A full 80% in the US of those workers who have chosen not to go back to work are women, and we need to ensure that we protect the progress that had been made up until now, trying to keep women in the workplace. And so, the importance of ensuring that we look at governance broadly, ensuring diversity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:07:00</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">And then you layer in the activities in the US and the social unrest, and the need to ensure in Canada that we have good BIPOC representation, that we are looking to people of colour, the Black and Indigenous, and ensuring that they have a voice around the table. It&#8217;s an important component for sure of good, strong corporate governance.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">KM</td>
<td valign="top">I&#8217;d say one more thing to add to what Judy just said, which is, this was an unusual situation. The knowledge workers as I call them, so think of people in the legal community, finance community, etc, they were able to pick up, go home and work, keep their incomes, keep their salaries, and actually probably save a lot more money than they&#8217;ve ever saved, because they couldn&#8217;t go out and spend.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:07:31</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">Whereas, parts of the other ends of the economy, the service workers who have to work in the restaurants, the bus boys, the dry cleaners, the hair salon worker, who was forced into harm&#8217;s way and had to literally be taken out of the workforce, lost their income, and while there were subsidies to help, you&#8217;ve really created a furthering of the have and have nots in an inequality standpoint. And so, it&#8217;s not just about the people who&#8217;ve lost, and to Judy&#8217;s point, the people who won&#8217;t come back to the workforce because they have to make a choice to either take care of their children, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:08:03</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">These are real issues that I think if we don&#8217;t deal with them now, we&#8217;re going to have decades-long ramifications.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">DP</td>
<td valign="top">Martin, from an investor&#8217;s standpoint, when you&#8217;re looking at factors related to the E and the S and the G, going forward, when you&#8217;re assessing companies or looking for investments, how does that play out for you? Do you see the focus maybe shifting towards a little bit more of the S and the G going forward, and maybe it has been in the past?</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:08:27</td>
<td valign="top">MG</td>
<td valign="top">Well, you know, from a portfolio standpoint, we&#8217;re always looking for the issues that drive the financials more obvious. So, environmental issues, because often there&#8217;s regulatory, because there&#8217;s often a lot of technology involved in meeting the regulation, it&#8217;s often a more material driver from a financial standpoint. But that&#8217;s not to say that the social or governance issues aren&#8217;t also important in deciding what capital to work. And I think if you look at it from the large asset owner perspective, so the largest, for instance, pension funds in the world.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:08:57</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">They&#8217;re increasingly focused on that social dynamic. I think one of the areas that is perhaps not as well explored, and probably will be in the future, is around margins versus wages. There had been this view that creation of wealth was something that could happen and bring everybody along. Clearly, the rates of inequality in various segments in the world have now gotten to the point where we really haven&#8217;t seen this since the aristocracy era, back 100 years or more before.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:09:30</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">So, we&#8217;re now at a level of inequality where we know that wealth creation in itself doesn&#8217;t necessarily lift all boats. It creates further dispersion within economies. And I think that is the tension that needs to be grappled with in the financial community, where of course we want companies to have the best margins possible. But if that is at the detriment of workers in terms of maintaining jobs or paying a liveable wage, then perhaps we need to reassess what we mean by success in creating wealth.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">00:09:57</td>

<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">DP</td>
<td valign="top">That&#8217;s a difficult conversation to have, between an investor and a company that they might be investing in. Does that change the dynamic going forward a little bit?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">MG</td>
<td valign="top">Well, for sure. It&#8217;s a seriously difficult discussion. Just think of what a fiduciary responsibility is at the pension fund level. It&#8217;s to the retirement of those individuals, but those individuals are within the context, in a fairly good situation. Over half of society probably doesn&#8217;t have access to pension.</td>

<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">

<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">KM</td>
<td valign="top">I&#8217;ll add to what Martin said, I think that tension has been more visible recently, certainly if you look in Canada and the US with the push on minimum wage. It&#8217;s now not appropriate to not pay your workforce at the right level of a sustainable wage. And so, the shareholder has to look at that and say, it&#8217;s not only helping, it&#8217;s the right thing to do, versus this trade off of, I can boost my margin at the expense of a large employee base.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #e8eaea;">
<td valign="top">00:11:01</td>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">So, I&#8217;d say the awareness over the last probably two years, certainly in the US and Canada, is starting to take hold on that. And that tension, while it&#8217;s there, I think it&#8217;s a good one.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"></td>
<td valign="top">MG</td>
<td valign="top">And increasingly, we have the large pension funds who are asking their asset managers to engage with the corporates on that issue. To say, you&#8217;ve got through COVID reasonably well, but what was the share of the pain that was felt through the organization, and how many people did you have to furlough and lay off? And by the way, was their pain taken by senior execs as well?</td>

<td valign="top">And within this environment, Judy, it&#8217;s not a balance that needs to be struck, but on the one hand you do have some brands and some companies that there&#8217;s quite a bit of virtue signalling out there right now. But this needs to turn to action at some point. But sometimes, that&#8217;s a bit of a process. That&#8217;s not something that you just flip a switch on.</td>

How do we give people tools to address those issues? It really is about training the workforce and making sure that we&#8217;re all acutely aware and turning it into action. So, how else can be corporately support organizations that meet the values that we&#8217;re wanting to promote and address these issues at the core? How do we address systemic issues by again, aligning with organizations from a corporate sponsorship perspective?</td>

I think nothing really gets going without rhetoric initially, but increasingly, certainly investors, consumers are willing to go beyond the rhetoric, beyond the pledge and say, what have you accomplished? Even down to the corporate level, when we&#8217;re engaging, we have to go beyond simply saying, yes, we raised it as an issue, but also say, well and here&#8217;s how we followed up. Here&#8217;s how we ensured there was an impact from our engagement, and here&#8217;s what this company is actually doing.</td>

There&#8217;s an expectation that the company is going to be pretty good in some areas and needs to be brought along in others, especially for the type of investment that we&#8217;re looking for in my fund, they need to be pretty far along in all aspects. But they&#8217;re never going to be perfect in all of them. Engagement has to, for us, investing in the company that has the right product or solution, has the right management focus or attitude around these issues, and is willing to continuously improve on them.</td>

So, as the world re-opens, do they drive more, instead of being able to transport people in a larger fashion, in a more environmentally friendly way, do people go back to old habits?

So then, because of something like that, I&#8217;m not going to my office every day, I don&#8217;t need to get on the train, and they think about the environment, maybe it does take the option out.

And it&#8217;s almost regardless of whether it&#8217;s an EV or not. An EV is better, but there&#8217;s a tremendous emphasis right now on improving walking, cycling lanes. There will be a hit to mass transit, there&#8217;s no doubt, but I think the funding for mass transit, the economics of it will be negative in the short term but the government will be stepping in with more funding there.</td>

And so, there&#8217;s a huge positive from that perspective in terms of enhancements overall to the city and to the environment.
