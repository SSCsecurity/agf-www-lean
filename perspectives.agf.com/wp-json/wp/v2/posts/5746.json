In fact, with the right currency hedging strategy in place, many of today\u2019s negative rates can still result in positive returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"829\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Negative-Yielding-Debt-e-01-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5748\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Negative-Yielding-Debt-e-01-1.png 1200w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Negative-Yielding-Debt-e-01-1-300x207.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Negative-Yielding-Debt-e-01-1-768x531.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\"> Source: Bloomberg L.P. as of October 31, 2019. Totals calculated using the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index <\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>This is particularly true of\nthose hedging back to the currency of a country that has a domestic bond market\nwith a favourable interest rate differential compared to another nation\u2019s bond\nmarket.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take for example, the\nscenario of a Canadian investor who is considering the purchase of a German\nbund. A euro-denominated 10-year bund yields\naround -0.40% , while the yield on a Canadian-dollar-denominated\nCanada 10-year bond is closer to 1.5%. Because this differential is expressed\nin the foreign exchange market between the two currencies, it\u2019s possible for\nthis investor to buy the 10-year German bund hedged back to Canadian dollars\nand earn around 1.9% (calculated based on a 3-month F\/X forward contract).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the investor\nwould earn more from a bond, which on the surface is earning a negative yield,\nthan they would by simply owning the Canada 10-year bond equivalent in their\nhome currency. And this isn\u2019t an isolated case. The same shift from negative to\npositive yield would also be true to varying degrees for an investor who hedged\nthe same German bund in U.S. dollars or the currency of any other nation\nboasting a favourable\u2014and sufficient enough\u2014interest rate differential. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this works in\nreverse as well. A U.S. 10-year Treasury, which yields roughly 1.7%, would earn\nonly 1.4% for an investor who hedged it back in Canadian dollars because of the\nextent the interest rate differential is currently in favour of the U.S.\nTreasury market over Canada\u2019s.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s also important to remember that interest rate differentials are constantly changing and won\u2019t always work in the same favour or to the same degree as they may have previously. U.S. Treasury rates, for instance, could fall from current levels and close the gap with other countries if the U.S. Federal Reserve cuts rates further.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, a currency hedging strategy that takes these differentials into account can help investors navigate today\u2019s bond market and even find yield where it seems there is none.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of October 31, 2019 and should not be considered as investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy and\/or sell securities.
