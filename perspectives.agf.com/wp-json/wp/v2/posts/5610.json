You might even\nsay it\u2019s on life support.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And given that it is responsible\nfor generating untold trillions in shareholder value over the past few decades\nwhile lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty, it\u2019s little wonder so many\nbemoan the near future as capital retrenches around the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet it\u2019s not all bad news for\ninvestors. In fact, there appears to be a silver lining as Asia\u2019s emerging\neconomies rush out their welcome mats, positioning themselves to reap the\nspoils of China\u2019s woes\u2014from ongoing trade wars and rising tariffs, to the swell\nof populism.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Countries like Vietnam, Thailand,\nIndonesia and India are now poised to become the next wave of winners as\ndecades-old relationships are remapped, and new ones forged. However, investors\nlooking for a long-term play would be wise to consider each country as its own\nasset class, each with its own economic policies and drivers of growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How did we get here? <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While globalization has been underway since the birth of\nthe telegraph and the Pacific railroad, it has waxed and waned over centuries.\nHowever, the most recent wave truly gained momentum following the North\nAmerican Free Trade Agreement when U.S. car manufacturers out-sourced much of\ntheir labour to Mexico and later, with China\u2019s admission to the World Trade\nOrganization in 2001. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For\ndecades, China built its economy as the world\u2019s factory floor for cheap goods.\nHowever, over the past decade, China has been undergoing an astonishing\ntransformation\u2014from serving as an imitator, to a country focusing\non moving up the value chain through technology advancements, thereby\nthreatening the global order and the United States\u2019 dominance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has created a domino effect in local, emerging\nmarkets\u2014a shift that has already been well underway but is accelerating in the\nwake of ongoing trade wars as businesses seek to reorganize their manufacturing\ninvestments to avoid U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tomorrow\u2019s\nemerging market players <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vietnam\u2019s industrial parks have been quietly\nfilling up as companies look to hedge against rising political uncertainty. One\nof the world\u2019s fastest growing economies, Vietnam has recently opened its doors\nto the world and boosts several advantages over its Asian neighbours. Firstly,\nit is located next China, making for convenient shipping. Consider that it is also cheaper\nthan Malaysia, more stable than the Philippines and Thailand and more\naccessible than Indonesia. What\u2019s more, Vietnam\u2019s factory workers earn about\nhalf of what workers earn in China\u2019s big manufacturing zones. And with about 70%\nof its citizens under 35, and with more than one million joining the labour\nforce every year, according to the World Bank, Vietnam has a steady flow of\nlow-cost labour for the near future. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, some see the global trade\nwars as a second chance forIndia to\nrealize its growth potential, based on its scale in terms of power generation,\nstructural availability, favourable demographics and the spate of new reforms\nannounced in recent months. While the country\u2019s current economic woes have been\nwidely telegraphed, the Indian government is implementing a number of stimulus\nmeasures designed to jolt the moribund economy while attracting new foreign\ninvestment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government recently announced\nsteps to liberalize foreign direct investments regulations in manufacturing and\nretail sourcing, lowering the tax rate of 17% and now allowing 100% direct\nforeign investment in contract manufacturing in the auto sector\u2014an important\nmove that will help India establish more integrated supply chains based in the\ncountry. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>IndonesiaandThailand are also\npoised to benefit from moves out of China. Indonesia is well-equipped to\nundertake some of China\u2019s manufacturing capacity with a workforce comprised of\n260 million under the age of 21, World Bank figures show. The government\nrecently announced it will open up new sectors of the economy to foreign\ninvestment and introduce labour reforms by year\u2019s end.&nbsp; One Taiwanese-based electronics manufacturing\ncompany already had a subsidiary in Thailand before the U.S-China trade spat\ndeepened. It now plans to continue to build capacity in Thailand, as well as\ngrow a footprint in India. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it isn\u2019t the only company with a\nhead start in uprooting from China. Another Taiwanese-based company, a textile\nmanufacturer working with big sporting and lifestyle companies, already has\nmuch of its garment capacity in Vietnam and has plans to build new fabric\nplants in Indonesia. Meanwhile, one of South Korea\u2019s largest electronic\ncompanies has already pulled production out of China altogether, and is also\nlikely to gain market share from the fallout from the U.S. government\u2019s trade\nban on companies like Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Regina Chi a vice president and portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc.
