For weeks, investors acted as if an imminent deal between the U.S. and China was a sure thing \u2013 only the Ts needed to be crossed and Is dotted. However, that\u2019s no longer the case and tensions have once again escalated with the U.S. hiking tariffs on Chinese imports and China retaliating. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this could be nothing more than the latest strong-arm negotiating tactic in the drawn out affair, it has ruffled feathers, leading to an increase in market volatility this month that is tough to ignore. And even if a deal is eventually reached \u2013 and that still seems most likely \u2013 the chance that tensions flare further and contribute to more uncertainty in the days and weeks ahead is real.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h3 style=\"text-align:center;padding:5%\"><strong><em>&#8220;If a deal is eventually reached \u2013 and that still seems most likely \u2013 the chance that tensions flare further and contribute to more uncertainty in the days and weeks ahead is real.&#8221;<\/em><\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether that\u2019s enough to capsize the recent rally may also depend on the Fed\u2019s next steps. At last count, there is unanimous agreement that the U.S. central bank will not raise rates this year, with odds of a rate cut still north of 50%. This despite recent comments from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell that there is not a strong case to cut or hike rates at the moment. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, who\u2019s right? The potential of a rate cut may have a lot\nto do with the fact that central bank reserves have dwindled and could result\nin tighter conditions if not counteracted. The real key, however, is the state\nof the economy and inflation rate. At least for now, signs of economic weakness\nhave subsided and, with the 10-year U.S. treasury yield now roughly 75 basis\npoints lower than late last year, the current backdrop may be enough to spur on\nmore spending in areas like the housing market without having to cut rates\nfurther. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, inflation may not be as benign as\nproponents of a rate cut claim. Yes, core price levels have fallen further below\nthe Fed\u2019s target inflation rate of 2% this year, but by definition this doesn\u2019t\naccount for food and gasoline prices, both of which are on the rise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In part, this omission makes sense. Gasoline prices can be\nvolatile and move up and down frequently based on the underlying price of oil,\nbut higher food prices are more likely here to stay. The price of a cup of\ncoffee, for instance, goes up when coffee bean prices do, but when do you ever\nsee the price of a cup fall when bean prices are headed downward? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, the price of pork is expected to climb from the African\nswine flu epidemic in China that is forcing the country to kill off one quarter\nof its 400 million pig population. But restaurants who raise their prices because\nof it aren\u2019t likely to lower them sometime down the road. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from this argument, the Fed still has to weigh the\nprospect of wage growth as it contemplates its next move. One of the most surprising\nelements of this economic cycle has been the conspicuous absence of fatter\npaycheques despite months of record low unemployment rates. Eventually, though,\nhigher wages could be a real deterrent to lowering rates and even swing the\nFed\u2019s thinking towards another hike. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, there\u2019s nothing that investors should take for\ngranted. Stocks may climb from here, but at this stage in the earnings growth\ncycle, even the slightest deviation from what\u2019s priced in could result in a\nsetback. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kevin McCreadie is Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at AGF Management Ltd.
