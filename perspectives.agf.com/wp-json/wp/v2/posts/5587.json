The issue is also raising vexing\nquestions for those with an interest in responsible investing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the issue illustrates the kind of\ndifficult tradeoffs investors concerned with environmental, social and\ngovernance (ESG) issues are often forced to consider. On the one hand, many\ninvestors are concerned with improving working conditions as well as human\nrights violations. On the other, many of these same investors are also interested\nin protecting the environment and ushering in the next technological revolution\ndriven by new technologies like EVs and renewable energy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moreover, the issue isn\u2019t just being\ndenounced by human rights advocates around the world. Increasingly, companies are\neager to clean up their supply chains, are also demanding ethical standards be\nenacted covering all cobalt mining in the Congo which produces the vast\nmajority of the world\u2019s supply. However, while there are initiatives in the\nworks, rigorous and broadly accepted standards are still a ways off.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue hit close to home this last\nsummer when dozens of miners were killed in the Congo on the property of a\ncompany listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, raising concerns about the grave\nrisks artisanal miners take to scour tailings and waste rock in search of\nvaluable metals. And while these miners were working illegally on the property,\nensuring appropriate safety conditions remains a challenge even for the mining\ngiants.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some worry that working conditions will be\nslow to improve given that China\u2014a country with a weak track record on working\nconditions\u2014controls a majority of the world\u2019s cobalt. China has been bulking up\nits cobalt supply to fuel its plans to further boost its fleet of EVs in a bid\nto establish technology leadership as well as to tackle pollution. Although,\nthe market has slowed in the short term as China has revised its subsidy scheme,\nit\u2019s currently the world\u2019s largest producer of EVs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile,\nimportant players like&nbsp;a Brussels-based global&nbsp;leader in cathode\nmanufacturing&nbsp;are&nbsp;committing to ethical sourcing despite the higher\ncosts this may entail.&nbsp;However, the market seems unmoved by\nits&nbsp;stance,&nbsp;punishing the company for near-term margin\npressures&nbsp;and&nbsp;its revised plans to scale back production due to\nsubsidy changes.&nbsp;The reality is that the big miners from which the company\nsources are likely the first to shut down production when prices decline, while\nartisanal supplies continue unabated.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However,\nthere seems to be a larger issue at play here for investors wanting to unleash\ntheir capital to make an impact\u2014and quite frankly, it\u2019s where the rubber truly\nhits the road. Among the key tenets of&nbsp;impact investing is the desire to\nproduce beneficial social or environmental outcomes that wouldn\u2019t be possible\nwithout the investment.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some\nwould claim this isn\u2019t possible in public markets&nbsp;and it\u2019s&nbsp;better to\nidentify and minimize the environmental, social and governance risks that come\nwith public markets. However, shouldn\u2019t responsible investors be willing to\nprovide a stable source of capital to a leading company that is trying to\nimprove working conditions&nbsp;for a key material&nbsp;needed&nbsp;in the\ntransition to cleaner energy?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy\ntransitions are high in&nbsp;financial and ESG risks\u2014both for&nbsp;the&nbsp;incumbent\nplayers as well as newly-emerging supply chains.&nbsp;While existing players\nhave&nbsp;entrenched business models&nbsp;and&nbsp;broad index representation,\ncompanies in emerging supply chains are inherently more volatile and attract\nfewer truly-engaged shareholders.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s\nlittle question the financial rewards of this transition are significant for\nwell-positioned companies. But it does require a long-term horizon and, more\nimportantly, a recognition by&nbsp;responsible investors&nbsp;that\nthey&nbsp;will need to transfer an increasing proportion of their risk budget\nfrom entrenched to emerging players.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The\nconsequences of not doing so are simply too high.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad<strong><em>Martin Grosskopf is a\nVice-President and Portfolio Manager at AGF Investments Inc.<\/em><\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><h5><small>The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of\ninformation based on information available as of October 4, 2019 and should not\nbe considered as investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy and\/or\nsell securities.
