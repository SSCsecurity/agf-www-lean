That\u2019s good enough to bring its share of assets under management to $29.1 billion or 19.2% of total ETF assets (see chart).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2679\" src=\"http:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/chart-v2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/chart-v2.jpg 800w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/chart-v2-300x172.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/chart-v2-768x441.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>More recently, 12 of the 20 new ETFs launched in May were also actively managed and going forward, we believe they will continue to proliferate as investors who use exchange traded funds become even more sophisticated in their understanding of the potential benefits.<\/p>\n<p>This will be driven in large part by the demands of an increasingly uncertain market environment and growing necessity among ETF investors for active strategies that create better opportunities for risk-adjusted returns.<\/p>\n<p>But growth may also hinge on possible changes to the regulatory backdrop that could open up the sale of exchange traded funds to Mutual Fund Dealers Association (MFDA) representatives. Already comfortable with active management as a way to build wealth, active ETFs could be a natural fit for this group of advisors.<\/p>\n<p><em>Florence Narine is senior vice president, head of products at AGF Investments Inc.
