The goal of a real\nasset strategy is to invest in long-term physical assets that generate\nattractive, risk-adjusted returns as a cushion against business cycle volatility\nwith a focus on controlled risk and industry diversification.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>What does a real asset investment add to an equity portfolio?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The assets in\nthe real asset universe tend to be less correlated to the broader market\nindices and therefore offer a broader source of diversification. They also tend\nto be more highly correlated to inflation, offering an improved hedge, or\nprotection against inflation. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How might a real asset fund be structured?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The investment\nuniverse could include investments in global materials, energy, real estate and\nInfrastructure industries. This could include everything from airports and\nhighways (infrastructure) to power generators and distributors (utilities),\nminers, gold miners, smelters, &nbsp;chemical\nproducers, fertilizer and streel companies ( materials), all varieties of\nglobal real estate REITS ( residential, office, specialty ), global integrated\noil companies, oil exploration and production companies, pipelines, service\ncompanies and petroleum refiners.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fund might also\nconsider associated businesses, where there\u2019s a strong link to a core investment\nsector. For example, this might include pipe providers to drilling companies, or\na technology company focused exclusively on mining applications.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>How do you find the right asset allocation of real assets to invest in?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Asset managers\nwould want to evaluate the relative risk\/return opportunity in each sector in\nlight of the broader economic and market outlook by looking at potential\nsector\/equity returns and return volatility, as well as the correlations (or lack\nthereof) between sectors to evaluate the net impact to the portfolio.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The equity\nselection is the dominant driver of portfolio construction, with sector\nallocation being utilized as a risk monitoring\/management tool.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>How do you evaluate\nthese holdings? Is it different than evaluating stocks? <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The selection portfolio\nprocess starts with an initial screening to reduce the universe to a narrower\nselection of possible assets. This would be followed by a fundamental analysis\nwith economic\/market forecasts applied to seek out the best risk\/reward\nopportunities in the group. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asset managers\nwould also look for unique investment opportunities which may not have\nregistered using the screens already applied. This may provide other opportunities\nin the portfolio. Broadly, the portfolio will contain the following assets:\nfirstly, those \u201ccore holdings\u201d which are the businesses and companies that we\nare likely to hold through a full, economic cycle; secondly, \u201cmacro plays\u201d where\nwe have sought exposure to a broader macro theme; and thirdly, \u201copportunistic\u201d\ninvestments, where the thesis is unique to the equity selected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The portfolio\nassembly process examines the relative correlations across the equities and\nsectors to balance our risks and exposures to broad market variables. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Where do the best o<strong>pportunities lie at the moment?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s\nespecially difficult to predict in this period of higher volatility where\nmaking decisions based on both the short and long-term pose both risks and\nopportunities. The commodity producers appear to be unduly discounted based on\nour assessment of their longer term cash flow generation capability, but remain\nout of favour due to the perception and risk of a near-term economic slowdown. Meanwhile,\nbusinesses participating in the growth of the global LNG market are well\npositioned for long-term growth and aren\u2019t expensive. I believe there may also\nbe interesting opportunities in global integrated energy firms given that cash\nflow generation is being unduly discounted.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What is the biggest challenge at the moment?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>From my\nperspective, the global investment landscape is as fluid as it has ever been\nwith an increasing presence of \u201cknown unknowns\u201d in the market. Additionally, it\nfeels like we are on the cusp of a marked change in what\u2019s driving markets.\nMore specifically, for more than a decade, the market has been driven by momentum\nand growth whereas there\u2019s potential for a \u2018\u2019regime\u2019\u2019 change whereby future\nmarkets may be driven by price. And that could get messy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are\nprobably three key risks that I am spending the most time thinking about ( or\nare keeping me up all night), and to an extent, they are related:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Economic cycle risk<\/strong>: It has been a long\neconomic cycle with a rotating series of drivers, and it\u2019s not clear how the\nnext few years will play out.&nbsp; We have\nnot had to invest before in a period of such low interest rates and inflation\nat the later part of an economic cycle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Geopolitical Risk<\/strong> (which links to the\npoint above): Brexit, conflict in the Persian Gulf, sanctions against\nIran, trade disputes with China\u2014all of these conflicts are difficult to assess\nand forecast, and in many cases, have bimodal outcomes. In other words, the\noutcome won\u2019t be neutral\u2014it will be either positive or negative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile,\nthere are a number of potentially interrelated factors to consider that could\nalso meaningfully impact global trade flows and commodity supply.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investor Perception\nRisk:<\/strong> The recent market has\nbeen very \u201cthematic\u201d&#8211;relative valuations for much of the market have been\ndriven by longer-term themes or expectations rather than nearer term cash flows\nand earnings that include themes such as electric vehicles, battery technology,\ncarbon reduction, Cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the real asset\nspace, this has induced exceptional volatility in commodities associated with\nEV\u2019s (lithium), for example.&nbsp; This has\nleft the broader commodity space largely unloved.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A question we\u2019re\ncurrently asking is: Have valuations for commodity producers been permanently\ndevalued\/contracted? Is this just part of the normal cycle or, with the\nevolution of demographics and changing public perception, is the group now\nposed to trade below historical normal valuations?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5><small>The commentaries contained herein\nare provided as a general source of information based on information available\nas of August 12, 2019 and should not be considered as investment advice or an\noffer or solicitations to buy and\/or sell securities.
