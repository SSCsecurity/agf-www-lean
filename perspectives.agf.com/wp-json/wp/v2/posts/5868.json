Even\na trade truce may not help much given concerns in sectors such as agriculture,\nenergy and autos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the BoC took the unusual step of mentioning\nCanadian dollar strength during its last policy meeting, something it has\ngenerally been reluctant to comment on. Its tolerance for further strength from\nhere seems limited. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given this backdrop, the Bank of Canada finds itself in a\ndubious position. Its policy rate is currently the highest in the developed\nworld, according to Bloomberg data, and with potential risks to the economy\nlooming, it seems untenable for the central bank to stand aside much longer\u2014especially\nif the Fed cuts further than it already has this year. At the very least, the Bank\nof Canada may have no choice but to match the U.S. central bank\u2019s next few moves.\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That, in turn, could have positive implications for Canadian bonds that have already been impacted by the divergent stances taken by both Canada and the U.S. regarding interest rates. \u00a0More to the point, over the course of the past year, the yield on a 10-year government bond issued in Canada went from 85 basis points below its U.S. equivalent to just 20 basis points more recently. Meanwhile, the Canadian yield curve has also been inverted longer and more deeply than in the U.S. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of this suggests that Canadian bond yields should either\nrise less than U.S. yields if the recent rising trend continues or fall more\nthan U.S. yields if the reverse is true.&nbsp;\nEither way, the Bank of Canada is unlikely to pursue a more hawkish\nstance than its U.S. counterpart any more, and Canadian bonds seem like a solid\nopportunity relative to the U.S. from here.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>David Stonehouse is a Senior Vice-President and Head of North American and Specialty Investments at AGF Investments Inc.<\/em> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of\ninformation based on information available as of November 30, 2019 and should\nnot be considered as investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy\nand\/or sell securities.
