According to a recent McKinsey &amp; Co. analysis, almost all of China\u2019s major industrial enterprises&nbsp;had&nbsp;resumed production&nbsp;by the end of March, as had&nbsp;more than 90% of all government-owned firms and about three-quarters of SMEs outside Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. Today,&nbsp;China&nbsp;is operating at an estimated 80% to 90% of&nbsp;economic&nbsp;capacity \u2013 a remarkable spring-back&nbsp;from the lockdown situation&nbsp;of&nbsp;only a few weeks ago.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yes, China provides&nbsp;some&nbsp;hope to other regions still&nbsp;in the midst of&nbsp;dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. But that hope should be tempered by the very real potential that&nbsp;its&nbsp;recovery will be bumpier than preliminary indications suggest.&nbsp;The&nbsp;robust March Purchasing Manager\u2019s Index (PMI)&nbsp;data \u2013 including a mere 1.1% decline in factory output \u2013 could prove to be an anomaly. In fact, we anticipate&nbsp;a weaker than expected recovery&nbsp;in the second quarter, suggesting that what looks like a V-shaped recovery for China&nbsp;could&nbsp;end up&nbsp;as more of&nbsp;a W.&nbsp;Moreover, we see the COVID-19 environment accelerating existing secular trends in globalization and technology,&nbsp;which will have significant long-term implications for&nbsp;China, other&nbsp;emerging markets (EMs) and the global economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>China will play a&nbsp;central&nbsp;role in the unfolding COVID-19 story, as it has already. Its effective shutdown and corresponding decline in output disrupted global supply chains, but the dynamic&nbsp;is&nbsp;now&nbsp;shifting. Rather than a lack of output, China faces a decline in demand from Western economies that are in their own lockdowns. In effect, China\u2019s production could be all revved up with no place to go.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same goes for other countries in the global trade region, which could well get&nbsp;hurt&nbsp;over the next several months&nbsp;by the lack of Western demand&nbsp;\u2013 a&nbsp;challenge&nbsp;aggravated&nbsp;by continuing disruptions in supply chains. It\u2019s wise to remember that global supply chains don\u2019t flow one way. In many Asian manufacturing centres, critical components \u2013 especially those that are high-tech, proprietary and&nbsp;of&nbsp;very high quality, such as&nbsp;sensors and&nbsp;semiconductor equipment \u2013 are still often sourced from the United States and the European Union, where&nbsp;manufacturing facilities&nbsp;are&nbsp;largely closed&nbsp;due to the lockdowns.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>China\u2019s export sector is&nbsp;better insulated against those shocks than other EMs. According to a study&nbsp;by&nbsp;HSBC,&nbsp;the export economies of&nbsp;Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Vietnam and South Korea are the most exposed to global value chain disruption. Singapore tops the list&nbsp;because&nbsp;about two-thirds of its exports&nbsp;incorporate&nbsp;components from at least two other markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly,&nbsp;then,&nbsp;the timing and effectiveness of developed markets\u2019 reopening&nbsp;is&nbsp;critical to the shape of economic recovery&nbsp;in the short term.&nbsp;But what&nbsp;about the longer term? We see several likely trends.&nbsp;One is over-arching: an intensification of the&nbsp;move&nbsp;away from globalization and toward regionalization. The COVID-19&nbsp;environment has exposed inherent risks in globalized&nbsp;supply chains, and business leaders will be increasingly looking for ways to mitigate.&nbsp;We&nbsp;expect&nbsp;greater diversification in supply chain nodes, particularly&nbsp;away from&nbsp;China \u2013 a trend that was occurring already&nbsp;before the&nbsp;pandemic, and&nbsp;could benefit other emerging markets&nbsp;in the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a more general level, localization will be the new buzz word, as governments and manufacturers strive to reduce their dependence on one another (especially, and most obviously, when it comes to healthcare supplies).&nbsp;Local supply chains&nbsp;will&nbsp;become more robust and more decentralized. One potential upside: a revival of global industrial capex, which has been sluggish for the past couple of years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;COVID-19 environment and social distancing&nbsp;could also&nbsp;accelerate the secular trend toward&nbsp;automation. The pandemic has exposed&nbsp;new&nbsp;risks to the supply chain of a human labour force, and not just in manufacturing: some service industries&nbsp;(think fast-food restaurants)&nbsp;could also see more automation. Relative to the rest of the world, robotic density in Asia remains low, so&nbsp;there is room to grow.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, the recovery from the COVID-19 environment&nbsp;in China and the rest of the world&nbsp;is likely to&nbsp;be choppy, at best. And the outcome is unlikely to be a return to \u201cnormal,\u201d but rather a&nbsp;global economy that is less globalized. It might also be&nbsp;less reliant on humans, which could have important ramifications for&nbsp;traditionally&nbsp;low-labour-cost emerging markets.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously, much depends on the pathology of the pandemic itself. Yet if it turns out to be less an acute crisis than a chronic condition,&nbsp;the most pertinent question isn\u2019t whether the global economy will recover, but how it will adapt.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Regina Chi is a Vice-President and Portfolio Manager at AGF Investments Inc.
