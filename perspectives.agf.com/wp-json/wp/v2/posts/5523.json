It\u2019s a story\nthat\u2019s beginning to unravel as a glut of disappointing economic news begins to\npile up and India\u2019s official GDP figures are called into question. And while\nthe government is attempting to staunch the flow of bad news with a number of\nnew stimulus measures it is, in all likelihood, not enough to turn the economy\naround. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>By the numbers<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the figures. According to\nofficial government numbers, from fiscal 2011-12 and year-end 2016-17,\nIndia\u2019s economy expanded by about 7% a year. However, those figures were denounced\nearlier this spring by former high-level economic officials who claim India\u2019s\ntrue growth rate has been far slower. While the government has recently\nacknowledged growth is slowing the news got even grimmer last week. First\nquarter figures for the period ended in June showed growth slipped to 5%, led\nby a broad-based decline, with agriculture, industry and services as well as\ndrop in domestic consumption, according to Credit Suisse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market watchers had already been revising their forecasts before last\nweek\u2019s news. Morgan Stanley, for one, recently ratcheted down their outlook\nfigures for the year, citing weak domestic demand and continuing trade\ntensions. It pegged GDP growth at 6.3%, down from its former forecast of 6.5%.\nMoody\u2019s followed suit, downgrading India\u2019s GDP growth rate to 6.2% for the\ncurrent fiscal year, down from earlier estimates of 6.8%. It\u2019s important to note that these forecasts will need to\nbe revised, given the first quarter figures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes on the heels of dramatically slowing auto sales due to tight\nliquidity conditions led by the state banks and non-financial banking companies\n(NBFCs) who are faced with worsening credit quality and rising non-performing\nloans (NPLs). Earlier this month, the Society of Indian Automakers (SIAM)\nreleased figures showing sales of passenger vehicles slid 31% in July, the\nninth straight month of decline and the worst one-month drop in more than 18\nyears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government has responded to slowing growth by slashing its key lending\nrate to its lowest level in nine years. It\u2019s the fourth rate cut by Reserve Bank of\nIndia (RBI) in a year, and at 35 basis points, a more aggressive cut that\nmarket watchers were expecting. Meanwhile, just last week, the RBI issued a\nrecord US$24.4 billion payout to the government which will give authorities new\ntools with which to boost the economy, including the possibility of increasing\nspending to spur growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Structural issues<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly geopolitics are weighing on the economy. However, there are a\nnumber of structural issues that need to be addressed if India is to get back\non track. At the moment, sluggish domestic consumption, tight liquidity\nconditions and a weak capital expenditure cycle are all hurting economic\ngrowth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With low industrial capacity utilization, many Indian companies are\nfocusing on deleveraging. Concerns about a global economic slowdown are also\nkeeping them from increasing their capital spend in the short-term. Added to\nall of this is the double whammy in which India is juggling both a fiscal\naccount deficit as well as a current account deficit, putting even more\npressure on the economy when the US dollar strengthens against the rupee. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while the market cheered the landslide reelection of Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this spring, he\nsimply doesn\u2019t have as many instruments at his disposal to shake up a weakening\neconomy as do his counterparts in a managed economy like China. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line? The recent stimulus measures\naren\u2019t likely going to be enough to kick-start an economy that is slowing even\nmore than market watchers had expected and investors should take a cautious\napproach.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Investment opportunities<\/strong> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, we believe investors with an interest in India should look to in those companies with market exposure outside of the country. These companies have the added benefit of a weaker rupee which makes their exports and services much more competitive. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Regina Chi is Vice-President and Portfolio Manager, AGF Investment<\/em><strong><em>s <\/em><\/strong><em>Inc..
