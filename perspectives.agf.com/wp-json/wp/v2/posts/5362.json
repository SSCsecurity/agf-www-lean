Valuation spreads are based on Z-scores calculated by subtracting the trailing four-year average from a given data point divided by the trailing four-year standard deviation.<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>A similar outcome was also true of the S&amp;P\/TSX\nComposite Index in Canada during that time frame and, on indices both sides of\nthe border, there are several other instances in the past 20 years when larger\ndeviations in the valuation spread between low vol and value have resulted in\nmean reversion shortly after. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, the valuation spread between\nthese two factors has reached between two and four standard deviations away\nfrom the norm in the U.S. and Canada, respectively. Those are levels not seen in\nover a decade, suggesting value and\/or higher volatility segments of the market\nmay be due for an uptick in performance. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the very least, investors should be cautious about their exposure to low volatility stocks going forward and maintain a multi-factor approach to prevent from getting caught too much offside. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Abhishek Ashok is an analyst at Highstreet Asset Management Inc. and a member of the AGFiQ quantitative investment team.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">AGFiQ is a collaboration of investment professionals from Highstreet Asset Management Inc.
