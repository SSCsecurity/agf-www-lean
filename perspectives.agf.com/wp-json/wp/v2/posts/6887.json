What\u2019s behind the increase in volatility?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that the rally off the March bottom has been driven by a handful of big tech names that have vastly outperformed the broader cap-weighted indexes in the United States. And, of course, most of these companies have reaped a benefit from the economic lockdown, while other sectors of the economy have suffered greatly. But as the recovery begins to take hold\u2014albeit tenuously\u2014investors are starting to wonder whether the growth rates of some tech companies can stay on pace to support valuations that, in many cases, have climbed to extreme levels in recent weeks. Take businesses that include video conferencing as part of their services, for example, or those focused on e-commerce solutions. They were critical in allowing societies to function during the lockdown and generated terrific growth, but what happens to their revenue streams if life eventually picks up where it left off when the pandemic hit? Can sales be maintained at the current rate\u2014or even accelerate from here\u2014or will they begin to taper off? And what does a ratchetting up of tensions between the U.S. and China do to the tech sector given the latter\u2019s importance to supply chains and end-market demand? At this point in time it\u2019s not clear, but these are the types of questions now being asked by investors and parts of the market are likely to remain volatile for as long as they remain unanswered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Conversely, many of the companies that have been impacted negatively by the pandemic could stand to gain from a recovering economy. How does this affect the potential direction that markets take from here?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, it should give a boost to markets overall as beaten-down cyclical stocks are bid up on the prospects of better economic conditions and these gains help offset some of the expected weakness or flattening out in \u2018growthier\u2019 tech names that we\u2019ve already discussed. But that may not be exactly how this unfolds given some of the unique aspects of the current environment. Investors who are \u201cover-indexed\u201d by having large exposure to cap-weighted benchmarks like the S&amp;P 500 Index, for instance, are more susceptible to tech stocks selling off because of the sheer weight these names now carry in these indexes. At the same time, those whose portfolios are more reflective of equal-weighted indexes won\u2019t be hit as hard and may benefit in greater proportion from a subsequent climb in cyclical names. It\u2019s also unclear how neatly and tidily a market rotation of this kind would play out. After all, tech stocks may be due for a larger correction even if the recovery stalls and today\u2019s stay-at-home environment persists, but cyclical parts of the market are likely to rebound\u2014at least in a prolonged meaningful way\u2014only when there are surer signs of sustained economic growth going forward. &nbsp;Moreover, it remains to be seen what effect the massive increase in retail, self-directed investment over the past few months will have on this rotation. Will the selling of names these investors have loaded up on force them to exit the market altogether or will they stick around and find new opportunities to put their money to work? Again, there\u2019s just a lot of different variables at stake, which makes it that much more difficult to envision a clear path for markets one way or the other.&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In other words, expect even more volatility ahead?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that\u2019s right. We may be in for a stretch of muted returns offset by minor pullbacks. Many of the catalysts fueling the equity market rally earlier this summer may already be fully priced in, especially the prospects of a vaccine being approved later this year or early next. At the same time, we\u2019re in a bit of a lag regarding the release of economic data like third quarter GDP, which could provide a lift if surprising to the upside, and it\u2019s increasingly uncertain whether significant new stimulus measures are actually forthcoming despite them being talked about for months. The risk, meanwhile, of a second COVID-19 wave and economic setback can\u2019t be dismissed with schools back in session and case numbers rising in several countries. Then, of course, there\u2019s the looming U.S. election that may end up being the biggest risk of all. Investors need to be ready for the possibility of a disputed result that upends markets and further fuels the country\u2019s deepening social divide. So, unlike the fairly steady and outsized returns since the lockdown, we expect choppier markets ahead as we move through the fall.&nbsp; Equities may experience significant day-to-day volatility and remain range-bound until clarity on these issues\u2014and how they are resolved\u2014becomes apparent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kevin McCreadie is Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at AGF Management Ltd.
