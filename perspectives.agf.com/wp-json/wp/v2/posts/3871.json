At the same time, one in four surveyed want to further increase the emphasis paid to quantitative strategies in the future versus just 1% who want to de-emphasize their importance.<\/p>\n<p>Respondents listed a number of advantages related to a quantitative approach, but <em>diversification<\/em> (19%) and <em>consistency<\/em> (13%) were two of the most common benefits, with <em>risk management<\/em> (11%) and <em>consistent returns<\/em> (8%) not too far behind.<\/p>\n<p>The study also highlighted a growing affinity towards factor-based quantitative strategies and, in particular, multi-factor approaches that are actively-managed. In fact, 34% of those polled said they want to increase exposure to actively-managed multi-factor strategies, but just 14% are planning to beef up their emphasis towards actively-managed single-factor strategies.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, those with exposure to factor-based strategies said they prefer a strategic\/long term approach over a tactical or timing approach to factor allocation. And when asked to name the advantages of a factor-based approach, the most popular responses included <em>diversification<\/em> (23%), <em>better performance<\/em> (18%), <em>flexibility<\/em> (14%) and <em>risk management<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Other findings from the survey, meanwhile, suggest more education around these strategies is required. Smart beta, for instance, is often used by respondents interchangeably with factor-based investing, but is really just a rules-based mechanism for delivering it.<\/p>\n<p>Being long-time quants ourselves, much of these results have confirmed what we are seeing first hand in our conversations with investors. But the survey is also a good reminder that more can be done to help explain the important role quantitative strategies can play in a diversified portfolio.<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/capabilities\/quantitative\/index.jsp\">Explore our Quantitative Investment Capabilities<\/a><\/h3>\n<p><em>Mark Stacey is a senior vice president, head of portfolio management &amp; co-chief investment officer at Highstreet Asset Management Inc.
