This is true regardless of whether the analysis\nwas done using a trailing one, three, six or 12-month time horizon, suggesting\nshort-term moves in momentum accelerated over this stretch and bled into\nlonger-term moves, a rare occurrence.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"563\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/3-month-performance-e-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/3-month-performance-e-01.png 800w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/3-month-performance-e-01-300x211.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/3-month-performance-e-01-768x540.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/figure><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h5><small><em>Source: AGFiQ with data from FactSet as of August 2, 2019. Quintile spread of the three-month performance between stocks with the best and worst momentum in the S&amp;P\/TSX Composite Index over the trailing one, three, six, and 12-month time horizons.<\/em><\/small><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, such a synchronized outperformance in momentum has\nhappened less than 4% of the time since 2001 and has equated to a standard\ndeviation of 3.5 times above the average performance spread between winners and\nlosers. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, this is extreme and when happening in the past, it\nhas often been followed by a period of mean reversion that can flip the market\non its head.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. From a valuation\nstandpoint, there have only been two periods in the past twenty years in which\nstocks with the best medium to long-term momentum have been this overvalued\ncompared to those with the worst momentum.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/valuation-spread-e-01-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5411\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h5><small><em>Source: AGFiQ with data from FactSet as of August 2, 2019.
