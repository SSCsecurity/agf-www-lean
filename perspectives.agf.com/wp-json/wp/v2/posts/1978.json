Trump\u2019s beefs with Amazon include its alleged exploitation of the U.S. Postal Service, using it as the company \u201cdelivery boy\u201d, and Amazon not paying its full tax obligations. Media reports have widely connected Trump\u2019s position against Amazon to Jeff Bezos\u2019 personal ownership of The Washington Post, which has been critical of the President.<\/p>\n<p>Our take on the situation:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Amazon exploitation of the U.S. Postal Service is likely fake news<\/strong>. U.S. Postal Service financials show that Shipping Packages &amp; Services revenue has been growing at a ~14% CAGR since 2015, at a time when First Class and Standard Mail has been in secular decline. Simply put, e-Commerce has been keeping USPS afloat. Another way to look at it is &#8211; if Amazon did have an extremely unfair deal, one would expect revenue per parcel at USPS to be declining, since Amazon continues to become a bigger part of the mix. That is not the case as revenue per parcel has grown since 2015.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>That Amazon could pay more in state sales tax is likely real news\u2026\u2026but it\u2019s not all bad. <\/strong>For context, the issue has to do with 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party sales (Amazon currently collects and remits sales taxes for sales made directly by Amazon). The issue of allowing states to impose sales tax collection on sellers without physical presence in the state is currently being deliberated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Assuming a worst case scenario, we have seen some analyst estimates claim a worst case impact to EPS of -7%. However, we would note that any Supreme Court decision that results in more online retailers collecting sales taxes might actually push retailers towards selling on Amazon, which currently offers its 3<sup>rd<\/sup> party sellers an optional sales tax collection service for a 2.9% fee based on the collected sales taxes (which presumably would become a more attractive proposition to retailers facing bigger sales tax compliance costs).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Does the market care about taxes? <\/strong>Given that Amazon\u2019s forward P\/E is currently 79x, a worst-case scenario mid-single-digit hit to EPS is unlikely to be the thing that derails the Amazon train. Investors who own and who have interest in Amazon aren\u2019t deep value investors \u2013 rather they are likely more enthused by Amazon\u2019s suite of high growth businesses and the potential to continue to disrupt the way we live and do business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line<\/strong> \u2013Though government regulation across Amazon\u2019s business lines is an ongoing risk, the issues that Trump has brought forth thus far are likely either inaccurate (U.S. Postal Service) or not terribly alarming in our view (3<sup>rd<\/sup> party state taxes).&nbsp; We expect to stay the course and wait for the current tweet storm on Amazon to pass, as we have seen in the past.<\/p>\n<h5>Commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of April 3, 2018 and should not be considered as personal investment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
