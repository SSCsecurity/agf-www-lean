Not maybe as well as the U.S. market, which has outgained most of its global counterparts, but the Nikkei 225 has climbed 93% in Canadian dollars through October since the beginning of 2015, representing a return far more impressive than bellwether equity indexes in other parts of the developed world including Europe, the U.K. and Canada, according to Bloomberg data. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that may not be the end of its run. Japan\u2019s attractiveness as a cog in a well-diversified equity portfolio is not waning heading into the final months of 2020. The Nikkei\u2019s rebound off the March bottom has been stronger than all but the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq, according to Cornerstone research, and backed by a confluence of tailwinds, shares in many of the country\u2019s publicly listed companies are poised to push even higher in the weeks ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably, the most favourable tailwind is its deep discount to the United States based on price-to-book ratios. In fact, according to our research using Bloomberg data, the last time Japanese equities traded at a valuation spread this attractive to U.S. equities was in 2001, netting a total return in U.S. dollars of 133% in the subsequent three years and 115% after five years.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Equally intriguing, however, is the cyclical nature of Japan\u2019s market at a time when economic prospects are picking up in the wake of this year\u2019s pandemic-induced recession. According to Bloomberg, the country\u2019s recent second quarter earnings results beat expectations by 34% in aggregate, the widest margin in almost three years. And while investors won\u2019t likely be clear of the COVID-19 crisis until a vaccine is approved and administered broadly around the world \u2013 hopefully sometime next year \u2013 there are several signs that the global economy is on the mend. The Global Purchasing Manager Index (PMI), for instance, continues to push higher after bottoming this summer and now indicates a robust expansion is underway, according to the latest data through October. That would presumably be a big boost to most stocks regardless of jurisdiction, but especially Japanese equities that have a value tilt and tend to do well in the early stages of a new expansion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, the geographic earnings distribution of listed companies in Japan is far more balanced than it was in the past and may benefit from an economic recovery led by Asia-Pacific nations that have so far handled the pandemic better than countries like the United States, which is still seeing rising case counts and whose economy may be further burdened by its divisive and highly polarized political climate. To be more specific, the Asia-Pacific region is growing in importance for Japanese companies. In the fiscal year ending March 2019, almost 20% of Japanese earnings were derived from China, with a similar proportion of earnings coming from the U.S., according to research from Daiwa Securities. Going forward, we expect the contribution to earnings from China to exceed the U.S., as China\u2019s economic growth, and that of the broader Asia-Pacific region, continues to outpace the U.S. \u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s also no shortage of long-term catalysts favouring Japan. New Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga may end up being more aggressive on domestic policy than his predecessor and deliver on his promises of government reforms and de-regulation. His initiatives are expected to include a new Digital Agency that will be responsible for upgrading Japan\u2019s central and local government systems to support fully electronic filing and other paperless processing. The agency should ensure that long-term budgets on government space remain in place over the next decade and could bolster the country\u2019s software development and information technology services industry in the process. Mr. Suga is also set to re-align Japan\u2019s regional bank subsector, which would potentially spur M&amp;A activity and share price appreciation for companies involved, and like Mr. Abe before him, remains supportive of the Bank of Japan\u2019s aggressive reflationary monetary policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly, there are several good reasons to be bullish on Japan now, and that doesn\u2019t take into consideration other potential catalysts that may still come to the fore or that are difficult to quantify. What if, for instance, Japan\u2019s manufacturing industry is offered the chance to fill a sourcing void left by an escalating trade war between the U.S. and China? And what about Warren Buffett\u2019s recent US$7-billion investment in five Japanese trading companies? That\u2019s an endorsement if there ever was one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stephen Way&nbsp;is&nbsp;Senior Vice-President and Head of Global and Emerging Markets Equities at AGF Investments.&nbsp;He is a regular contributor to AGF Perspectives.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To learn more about our fundamental capabilities, please&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/capabilities\/fundamental\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">click here.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">The views expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of AGF, its subsidiaries or any of its affiliated companies, funds or investment strategies.<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of October 31, 2020 and should not be considered as investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy and\/or sell securities.
