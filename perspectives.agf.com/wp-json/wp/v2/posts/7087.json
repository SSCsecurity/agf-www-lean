Third Year\u2019s a Charm<\/strong><p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"438\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/third-year-e.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7088\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/third-year-e.png 1000w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/third-year-e-300x131.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/third-year-e-768x336.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 Index has netted positive annualized returns on average in each year of the four-year U.S. presidential cycles since 1960, but it\u2019s the third year in office that has coincided with the biggest gains. And what about the most volatile year of the cycle for stocks? That would be the first year, which corresponds with the largest average standard deviation of returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGFiQ with data from Bloomberg LP. Yearly index returns are based on inauguration dates starting January 20, 1961. Index performance related to Trump\u2019s current term ends as of September 30, 2020.<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2.

Moreover, through this lens, re-elections have been associated with much bigger equity losses and smaller gains. Barack Obama\u2019s first stretch in office, for example, syncs with the highest index return (101%) of any presidential term over this period, while gains during Bill Clinton\u2019s first term rank second (99%). However, both Richard Nixon\u2019s scandal-shortened second term and George W. Bush\u2019s final four years were met with index losses of more than 26%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGFiQ with data from Bloomberg LP. Returns are based on four-year presidential cycles starting on inauguration dates in January the year following an election and ending on the day before the next inauguration. With the following exceptions:&nbsp; Kennedy 1<sup>st<\/sup> term (January 20, 1961 through November 22, 1963), Nixon 2<sup>nd<\/sup> term (January 20, 1973 to July 31, 1974), Trump 1<sup>st<\/sup> term (January 20, 2017 through September 30, 2020). Johnson and Ford\u2019s unelected time in office following these two shortened terms between November 22 and January 19, 1965 and August 9, 1974 to January 19, 1977, respectively, are not included in these calculations.<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3.

The short answer is both, given how well the S&amp;P 500 has usually fared when <em>either<\/em> a Democratic <em>or<\/em> Republican President has held office during the past 60 years. The one big exception? George W. Bush\u2019s eight-year tenure bookmarked by the Tech Wreck and Great Financial Crisis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGFiQ with data from Bloomberg LP.

Meanwhile, in the eight instances of unified Democratic government, the S&amp;P 500 returned 26.7%, on average, or just one-tenth of a percentage point better than the average in the three terms of Republican control.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGFiQ with data from Bloomberg LP. Returns are based on U.S. congressional cycles since 1961 starting at the beginning of the month (January 1<sup>st<\/sup>) in which Congress convenes every two years and ends on the last day of the month (December 31<sup>st<\/sup>) before the next term is convened.

In fact, the <em>Washington Post<\/em> recently identified the campaigns of 1824, 1876, 1960 and 2000 as the only four in American history to produce contested outcomes. But if it does happen again, investors may want to watch out. Not only did the S&amp;P 500 fall during the month that George W. Bush\u2019s first-term victory was being contested, it also dropped in the 60 days before the election and 60 days after he was officially declared the winner.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGFiQ with data from Bloomberg LP. &nbsp;<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Past performance does not guarantee future results.
