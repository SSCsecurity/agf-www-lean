I am extremely proud to have carried the title of Honorary Colonel of the Canadian Army, and throughout my life, I have had the great privilege of getting to know many of our servicemen and women on a personal level. Their commitment to our country inspires me and was the driving force behind my decision in 2006 to establish <a href=\"https:\/\/www.canadacompany.ca\/en\/\">Canada Company<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Canada Company provides support for members of the armed forces and their families, including through the Canada Company Scholarship Fund, which has awarded $770,000 in scholarships to 74 recipients from 39 families since 2008.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scholarship fund was created as a living memorial to families who have lost a loved one in conflict or as a result of PTSD brought on by their time in service. It stands as a tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Remembrance Day, we are reminded that the valor \u2013 and the horrors \u2013 of war have inspired some of the most poignant poems ever penned, including <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cKoJvHcMLfc\"><em>In Flanders Fields<\/em><\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/legion.ca\/remembrance\/remembrance-day#:~:text=The%20Act%20of%20Remembrance,them%2C%20nor%20the%20years%20condemn.&amp;text=We%20will%20remember%20them.,We%20will%20remember%20them.\"><em>The Act of Remembrance<\/em><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=56_qGugvf9E\"><em>Commitment to Remember<\/em><\/a><em>. <\/em>But they\u2019ve also been a transformative force in Canada\u2019s art history.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, I\u2019m proud to announce the launch of the Art Canada Institute\u2019s new online book, <a href=\"http:\/\/aci-iac.ca\/art-books\/war-art-in-canada\"><em>War Art in Canada: A Critical History<\/em><\/a><em>,<\/em> by the renowned scholar, and former curator of art at the War Museum in Ottawa, Laura Brandon.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was honoured to help fund the development of this online book, which launched today and is available for free by clicking the above link. In addition to helping us remember our fallen, we hope the book will spark thought about the impact of conflict on creativity as well as the role war art plays in shaping Canada\u2019s national imagination and identity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lest We Forget.<br><br><em>Blake C.
