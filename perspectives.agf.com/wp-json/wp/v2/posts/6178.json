After all, the math works just the same in reverse when share prices eventually rebound from a fall and\/or yields start to climb again.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it does demonstrate the importance of ensuring government bonds with longer maturities are given a strategic allocation alongside other defensive options such as gold, real estate, staples, utilities, the U.S. dollar, or even cash in a broadly diversified portfolio. While these options have their merits, none has delivered as consistent and strong a return profile during adverse market conditions as long bonds.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it\u2019s equally important in today\u2019s low-yield environment to pair exposure to government bonds with higher-yielding bonds such as high-yield and investment grade credit, as well as emerging market debt and convertible debentures. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In doing so, investors will be better positioned to weather the kind of market volatility we\u2019re experiencing today while taking advantage of the opportunities that are bound to arise from it over time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>David Stonehouse, Senior Vice-President and Head of North American and Specialty Investments, AGF Investments Inc.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of March 6, 2020 and should not be considered as investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy and\/or sell securities.
