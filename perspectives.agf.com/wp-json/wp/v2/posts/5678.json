Here are three thoughts on how the result may impact financial markets in the days and weeks ahead. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Tough night for the energy sector<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The key question now is whether the Liberals decide to try and form a coalition with the NDP or Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, or if they look to work more on an issue-by-issue basis. Pipeline construction will continue to remain a hot topic, as the Liberal government wants to get it passed to help Western Canada, but by continuing to pursue that project, they may alienate the NDP and risk losing their support on other legislative issues. The energy sector also didn\u2019t get any favours from the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois&#8217; dramatic increase in seat count and return to official party status. The BQ is against further pipeline expansion, but said it will not form a coalition, choosing instead to vote on an issue-by-issue basis with support contingent on benefits to Quebec. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>More spending, larger deficits <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If a Liberal and NDP coalition holds, spending is likely to increase meaningfully and deficits are likely to get larger in the next two years.&nbsp;Canadians should expect budget deficits to continue to increase over the medium term, with tax increases at the top end of the income distribution to pay for the incremental spending. Higher deficits should point to a modestly weaker loonie over the medium term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Carbon pricing is here to stay <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Climate change policies\nwill continue to be a major focus for the Canadian economy,\nwith the Liberals and NDP pushing this as a major agenda item and continuing\nto&nbsp;proceed with carbon tax\nincreases, which will affect Canadian consumers to a greater degree in the\ncoming years. The Conservatives clearly didn\u2019t pass the test with voters on having a\nclear and decisive climate plan that would swing voters in the middle towards\nthe right. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, investors should expect limited stock market reaction on this outcome, but energy stocks won\u2019t get any relief bounce and could see a further deterioration in sentiment towards the space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mike Archibald is an Associate Portfolio Manager at AGF Investments Inc.
