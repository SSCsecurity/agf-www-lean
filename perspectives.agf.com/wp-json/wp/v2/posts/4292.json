After all, as history shows, recessions have a habit of happening on the heels of an inversion &#8212; especially when that inversion involves the spread between the two-year and 10-year note maturity.<\/p>\n<p>Even so, some investors may be overestimating the potential negative impact that an inverted yield curve can have on stock market returns. Based on our research dating back to 1977 of ten yield spreads along the U.S. Treasury curve, S&amp;P 500 Index returns remained, on average, positive in the year leading into an inversion, as well as the year following.<\/p>\n<p>The index\u2019s performance does weaken the closer time gets to the inversion date. But the inverted spreads that have coincided with the worst returns have tended to be those involving the three-month Treasury yield and longer-term maturities. Interestingly, an inversion of the two-year and five-year yield has corresponded to some of the better intermediate returns found in our research, while the recession-whispering two-year to 10-year inversion has generally occurred without pushing S&amp;P 500 performance into the red.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4293\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables.jpg 800w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables-300x131.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables-768x336.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><small>Source: AGFiQ with data from Bloomberg LP as of December 11, 2018.

The steeper it was, the worse the performance and vice versa. And not surprisingly, forward return profiles were better when fewer spreads along the curve inverted. In fact, it\u2019s only when there were seven or more spread inversions that future S&amp;P 500 performance turned negative and, even then, negative returns were relatively muted.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-4294\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"350\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables2.jpg 800w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables2-300x131.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Yield-Curve-Inversion-tables2-768x336.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><small>Source: AGFiQ with data from Bloomberg LP as of December 11, 2018.
