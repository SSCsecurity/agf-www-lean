Western military experts mocked the inept Russian invasion, which has run out of weapons and food &#8212; as morale plunges.<\/p>\n<p>NOW PUTIN FACES A DECISION: He can dramatically increase bombing of Ukrainian cities, and rely on help from Belarus, whose loathsome dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, will be sending his troops into northern Ukraine.<\/p>\n<p>EVEN THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH to subdue the brave patriots in Kyiv, who are willing to die for their country (one wonders how many Russian troops are willing to die for Putin). As Russian casualties mount, the key question will become clear: how long can Putin hold on before someone in his tiny group of cronies takes him out?<\/p>\n<p>THE NEW YORK TIMES REPORTED THIS MORNING that Russia\u2019s most senior military officer, Valery Gerasimov, sat stone-faced as Putin decreed that Russian nuclear forces should go on alert, &#8220;leaving some wondering what (Gerasimov) was thinking, and how he might respond.&#8221; Friction between Putin and his military could become a major part of this narrative.<\/p>\n<p>WHILE PUTIN HAS BECOME A GLOBAL PARIAH, the beleaguered U.S. President enters tomorrow night&#8217;s State of the Union address with a 37% job approval rating in the latest Washington Post survey. Joe Biden will barely mention his moribund Build Back Better bill; like virtually every Western leader, he will wrap himself around the superstar hero, Volodymyr Zelensky.<\/p>\n<p>WE BEGIN THIS WEEK with little optimism that talks between Russia and Ukraine will produce much; it could take many more days of Russian military defeats and a collapsing ruble before there&#8217;s a meaningful cease-fire. In the meantime the markets face extreme volatility, with war raging on the streets of Kyiv.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"Fineprint\"> \n\tThe views expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of AGF, its subsidiaries or any of its affiliated companies, funds or investment strategies.\n\t<br\/><br\/>\n\tThe views expressed in this blog are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of the date of publication and should not be considered as personal \tinvestment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
