Instead, what\u2019s needed is an allocation that\nmoves beyond these two traditional asset classes and takes cover in the growing\nuniverse of alternative investments.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s not to say investors should completely abandon the\n60\/40 concept. Stocks and bonds can still be an effective pairing for\ngenerating uncorrelated returns and they continue to provide important\ndiversification benefits at the core of most portfolios. In fact, 2018 is the\nonly year since 1969 that both asset classes have fallen in tandem during the\nsame year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch data. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yet, because this one occurrence happened just last\nyear, there is cause for concern. In the past, there was much greater assurance\nthat waning share prices would be offset by rising bond prices and vice\nversa\u2014so much so, that most investors took it for granted. At the same time, it\nwas widely agreed that the combination of stocks and bonds would provide\noverall returns that would adequately grow a portfolio to achieve most people\u2019s\ngoals over the long term.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that\u2019s no longer the case in a market environment that is now so clearly defined by tepid economic growth and persistently low yields. Take, for example, a simple 60\/40 portfolio that invests in the S&amp;P 500 index and U.S. 10-year Treasury notes. At the end of August, it yielded just 2.4%, tied for the lowest yield on record since 1915.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"796\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Historical-Yield_60-40-e-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5787\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Historical-Yield_60-40-e-01.png 1200w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Historical-Yield_60-40-e-01-300x199.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Historical-Yield_60-40-e-01-768x509.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: A Wealth of Common Sense blog, October 20, 2019<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>Granted, most 60\/40 approaches are far more diversified than\nthis and have the potential to net out with higher yields because of allocating\nto global equity markets and a variety of government and corporate bond issues\nfrom around the world. Even so, too many investors are ill-equipped to handle\nthe growing risk of a late-cycle economy that, sooner or later, will culminate\nin a recession and major equity selloff. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, the smart move in these instances was to hide\nout in bonds or go to cash and wait for the fallout to subside. During the\nfinancial crisis, for instance, investors could still earn close to 5% on U.S.\nshort-term rates, while those who bought longer maturity government bonds\nearned even more and benefited from capital appreciation once central banks\nbegan to slash rates aggressively. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, they\u2019d be lucky to earn a fraction of that and the\nrisk of owning bonds has become far greater given interest rates have never\nbeen lower and have turned negative in many parts of the developed world\nincluding Europe and Japan. In other words, it may not hurt you, but also may\nnot help you. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where alternative investments come in. From\nlong\/short equity strategies to real assets including infrastructure, real\nestate and\/or commodities such as gold, investors can enhance their 60\/40\nportfolios through different sources of potential yield and uncorrelated\nreturns. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In doing so, they will leave themselves in much better shape to preserve capital and still grow it in what is bound to become an increasingly volatile environment in the months ahead.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kevin McCreadie is Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at AGF Management Ltd.
