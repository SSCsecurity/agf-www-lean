This year, they included both leisure and business selections.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Adams, Chief Legal Officer &amp; Corporate Secretary<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAs a result of the ever- increasing importance of sustainability at AGF (and globally), I plan to revisit the Simon Sinek bestseller <em>Start with Why<\/em> given its insights into a better understanding of organizational purpose \u2013 a key consideration for companies that are thinking more sustainably.&nbsp;In addition, amongst the holiday family activities and events, I also plan to square away a little \u201cme\u201d time to take in Peter Jackson\u2019s sprawling seven+ hour Beatles break-up docuseries <em>Get Back<\/em>, which has been getting rave reviews. &nbsp;Can\u2019t wait!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>John Christofilos, Senior Vice-President and Chief Trading Officer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cAfter successive big return years in 2020 and 2021 in the equity markets, I will be reading quite intently the 2022 Outlooks put out by AGF (read AGF\u2019s Outlook <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/insights\/outlook-2022\/index.jsp\">here<\/a>) and other Financial institutions as to their outlooks for risk assets. I will also be reading a new book titled <em>The 5AM Club<\/em>. It is about owning your mornings to master your life. The author believes that winning starts at your beginning and the first hours are where the great heroes are made. On the personal side of viewing, I have my fingers crossed that Netflix will release new seasons of <em>Peaky Blinders, The Crown <\/em>and<em> Formula 1: Drive to Survive. <\/em>And the HBO\/Crave series <em>Succession<\/em> is my current viewing pleasure.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Arlette Edmunds, Senior Vice President &amp; Chief Human Resources Officer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI will be watching Ross Petty\u2019s <em>Alice in Wonderland<\/em> from the comfort of my home for the second year. I love Ross Petty and maybe 2022 is the year of live theatre in Toronto again.&nbsp; I\u2019ll also be working on AGF\u2019s HR 2022 strategy \u2013 lots of exciting changes coming \u2026 managing impacts to work with hybrid working and a new team and planning for an exciting move to CIBC SQUARE.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Lora Goldberg, Senior Vice-President and Chief Technology Officer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cDuring the holidays, I am anxious to finish reading <em>All The Light We Cannot See<\/em> by Anthony Doerr, a historical novel where a blind French girl and a German boy\u2019s paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of WWII.\u00a0 Right after, I plan to read <em>Cloud Cuckoo<\/em> <em>Land<\/em> by the same author; his latest and apparently his most ambitious to-date. We also plan to keep our family traditions going and watch <em>A Christmas Story<\/em> and <em>Elf<\/em>; both are light-hearted and good for a laugh.\u00a0 In the theatre, we will definitely catch Steven Spielberg\u2019s <em>West Side Story<\/em>, as much as it\u2019s hard to imagine even Spielberg improving on the original.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Judy Goldring, President &amp; Head of Global Distribution<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cEvery year around this time, I plan to read so many books in the upcoming year ahead and to get caught up with all the series and shows that have come out during the year.&nbsp;The truth is I am still reading the same book that I see Lora G. is reading \u2013 <em>All the Light We Cannot See<\/em>, by Anthony Doer.&nbsp;I think it was on my bedside table last year.&nbsp; That said, I do have a number of other interesting books I am keen to get to both fiction and non-fiction.&nbsp; For fiction, <em>What Strange Paradise<\/em>, by Omar El Akkad, this year\u2019s Giller prize winner, is on my list; for non-fiction, Mark Carney\u2019s book, <em>Values, Building a Better World for<\/em> All is a must-read, I am told!&nbsp; Always at Christmas, I watch <em>Elf<\/em>, <em>A Christmas Carol<\/em>, and of course, <em>It\u2019s a Wonderful Life<\/em>.&nbsp;All great classics in their own way.&nbsp;My number one choice for a Netflix binge will be <em>Succession<\/em>, given all the shenanigans in corporate Canada this year.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chris Jackson, Chief Operating Officer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI am looking forward to catching up on the latest season of <em>Billions<\/em>, which fits it into the rare combination for me of being something both business-related and a pleasure option. On the strictly pleasure side, I was a big fan of the previous <em>Dexter <\/em>series, and I am hoping to find time to check out the latest version that has just come out this year.\u201d<strong><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Katarina Savic, Senior Vice-President, Operations and Client Service<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI have a stack of magazines to catch up on, ranging from <em>Report on Business<\/em> to <em>Toronto Life<\/em> to <em>Design Lifestyle<\/em> (I still like old-fashioned paper magazines). I\u2019m also looking forward to checking out <em>14 Peaks: Nothing is Impossible<\/em> on Netflix \u2013 about a group of Nepalese mountaineers who summit 14 peaks in six months (I\u2019m exhausted just thinking about it!). All of the above while sipping Bailey\u2019s in my coffee, and of course spending time with my family.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Stonehouse, Senior Vice-President and Head of North American and Specialty Investments<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWhile economics is often considered a dry subject, it can be fascinating in the hands of a good writer with a distinct perspective. I\u2019m looking forward to reading <em>There\u2019s No Free Lunch<\/em> by David Bahnsen and <em>Bourbon for Breakfast<\/em> by Jeffrey Tucker, each of which challenges current economic thinking in different ways. On the leisure side, I\u2019m keen to watch The Beatles: <em>Get Back<\/em>, which provides a fresh view of the band\u2019s working and personal relationships.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Karrie Van Belle, Chief Marketing &amp; Innovation Officer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cTo be honest, I am not sure I have figured out what I am reading or watching this holiday season. I am frankly just looking forward to some down time from the race to and from hockey rinks so that I might actually be able to partake in a new TV series which is yet to be determined. I definitely have a long list of recommendations from colleagues and friends. That being said, we do have some holiday traditions and we will be watching our holiday favourites including <em>Christmas Vacation<\/em> and <em>Elf<\/em> while also playing various board games and cards &#8212; while the hockey games may have paused the competitive spirit does not.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of December 15, 2021 and should not be considered as investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy and\/or sell securities.
