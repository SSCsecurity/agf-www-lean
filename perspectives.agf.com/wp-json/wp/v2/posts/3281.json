Not so fast\" href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/insights\/market-commentaries\/articles\/article-a-secular-bear-in-bonds.jsp\">the risk of potentially higher rates.<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><b><strong>1. Strong historical protection in a rising rate environment <\/strong><\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Convertibles have historically provided a strong hedge in rising rate environments and significantly outperformed traditional bonds in each of the past five bond bear markets in the U.S. (i.e. when U.S. Treasury yields have risen). This has also been the case in the current bond bear market, which started in July 2016, and we expect this trend to continue if rates move up from here.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3282\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_convertiblebondchart.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_convertiblebondchart.jpg 800w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_convertiblebondchart-300x127.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_convertiblebondchart-768x324.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b><strong>2. Low correlation to other fixed income asset classes <\/strong><\/b><\/h3>\n<p>Convertibles tend to have a low correlation with other fixed income asset classes, which provides an extra layer of diversification within a portfolio. A less-than-perfect correlation with equities and even lower correlation with traditional bonds can dampen the overall volatility of a portfolio. Inclusion of convertibles can also potentially lower the volatility of an investor\u2019s overall portfolio, including equities, while enhancing returns, as it has done historically.<\/p>\n<h3><b><strong>3. Enhanced returns vs conventional bonds and downside protection vs equities <\/strong><\/b><\/h3>\n<p>The embedded call option within a convertible bond provides potential for upside participation with the underlying equity, while the fixed income component of a convertible bond provides investors with downside protection. The downside protection is partly a function of a convertible bondholder\u2019s ranking in the capital structure of a firm that would have them paid out before common equity holders in the case of a bankruptcy. Further, the intrinsic value of the bond also acts as a \u201cfloor\u201d for the convertible price. The price of a convertible will also tend to outperform traditional bonds in an upward trending stock market, while protecting on the downside versus equities in a declining stock market.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-3283\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_covertiblebondtable.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"322\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_covertiblebondtable.jpg 800w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_covertiblebondtable-300x121.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/FUND1127_07-18_E_covertiblebondtable-768x309.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Convertible bonds aren\u2019t without risks, of course. If a company&#8217;s stock trades well below the conversion price, for example, they may act more like a traditional bond and be susceptible to interest rates, inflation and company repayment risks. And if the stock meaningfully exceeds the conversion price, the converted shares could be exposed to greater equity market volatility.<\/p>\n<p>Still, we believe their potential benefits make them an essential tool in an investor\u2019s portfolio that can help manage risk and provide potentially enhanced returns should interest rates continue to move higher.<\/p>\n<p><em>David Stonehouse is a vice president and portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc.
