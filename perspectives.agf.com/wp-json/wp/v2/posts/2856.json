When combined with soaring small business confidence and an overall strong macro backdrop, this could lead to robust earnings growth in the quarters ahead.<\/p>\n<p>A strong mergers &amp; acquisitions (M&amp;A) environment, meanwhile, could be an additional catalyst of small\/mid cap performance going forward, particularly for those companies that are disruptive to incumbents and can be acquired at premium valuations.<\/p>\n<p>Last year was the third strongest out of the past 25 in terms of number of M&amp;A deals and with large cap companies receiving a bonanza in cash from tax savings and repatriations, the prognosis of continued strength remains positive.<\/p>\n<p>All added up, the domestically focused nature of U.S. small caps gives them a distinct attribute relative to their large cap and multinational counterparts. And while a broad market sell-off would impact all equities, those that have little foreign revenue exposure should be better protected from the first-order impacts of tariffs.<\/p>\n<p><em>Tony Genua is a senior vice president and portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc.
