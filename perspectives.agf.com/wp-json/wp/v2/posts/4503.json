A change that I\u2019m pleased to say AGF has already been supporting for many years and is ingrained in our corporate culture. <\/p>\n\n\n<div class=\"grid\">\n<div class=\"grid-element-50\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"380\" height=\"449\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-3521 size-full\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/judy-goldring-fire-390x230.jpg\"><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"grid-element-50\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"380\" height=\"449\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-3522\" alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/judy-goldring-quote-e-390x230.jpg\"><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n<p>Many companies are leading by example \u2013 with a higher representation of women directors and executives. As the President and Chief Administration Officer of a global asset management firm, I have made a commitment to champion change and improve diversity across our firm and our industry. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to diversity, and importantly, diversity\nextending beyond gender, we believe that smart corporate decision-making\nrequires different points of view, which come from people with diverse\nbackgrounds, experiences and perspectives working together. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that diverse boards are good for companies and\ngood for the economy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We currently have four women and six men \u2013 an industry\nleader at 40% \u2013 on our Board, which reflects our commitment to workplace\ndiversity. In fact, the representation of women on our Board has set the tone\nfor hiring practices throughout AGF. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With more than 30% of women in executive roles, we are\ncommitted to the advancement of women throughout the firm. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>At AGF we are committed to: <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Board Diversity \u2013 <\/strong>We endeavour to have the best people on our Board. AGF\u2019s Board is comprised of talented and dedicated directors with a diverse mix of expertise, skills and background. They bring new ideas, different perspectives and distinct voices to help AGF succeed. We recently interviewed the women on AGF\u2019s Board of Directors, who were happy to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/insights\/market-commentaries\/articles\/article-iwd-round-table-en.jsp\">share their thoughts<\/a> on what makes a board successful. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Internal Hiring Practices \u2013<\/strong> AGF\u2019s\nSustainability Council includes an initiative on people \u2013 retaining the best\ntalent and incorporating inclusion and diversity throughout the organization. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Supporting Industry Organizations \u2013 <\/strong>AGF is\na member of the 30% Club \u2013 an organization that encourages and supports\ncompanies to appoint more women at the board level as well as to senior\nmanagement roles. It\u2019s no secret that the financial services \/ wealth\nmanagement industry is still mostly male, yet AGF is well-represented at\nindustry organizations such as IFIC as well as female-focused events held by,\namong others, 100 Women in Finance, Women in Capital Markets, Women in ETFs,\nWomen in Wealth Management \u2013 Wealth Professional. <\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We are part of a positive change taking place throughout Canada. According to Osler\u2019s \u201c2018 Diversity Disclosure Practices: Women in leadership roles at TSX-listed companies\u201d report 28.4% of S&amp;P\/TSX board seats are now held by women, 68.8% of all companies have at least one female director and 18% of executive officers in financial services are women. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there is still\nwork do be done, these figures prove that we are entering an exciting period in\nhistory where the world expects balance. There is an understanding that balance\nis not a women\u2019s issue, it\u2019s a business issue. The race is on for\ngender-balanced boardrooms, a gender-balance of employees, a gender-balanced\ngovernment and more gender-balance in pay and wealth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The future is promising. The future is visible. The\nfuture is balanced. This International Women\u2019s Day, we can all reflect on the\nprogress being made and look for opportunities to champion and push social\nchange and diversity. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5><small>The views expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of AGF, its subsidiaries or any of its affiliated companies, funds or investment strategies.&nbsp;  <\/small><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<h5><small>AGF Investments is a group of wholly owned subsidiaries of AGF Management Limited, a Canadian reporting issuer.
