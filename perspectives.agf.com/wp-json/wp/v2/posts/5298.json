When a recession was experienced, the&nbsp;average&nbsp;forward one-year return was 11%, with most of the gains coming at the end of the 12-month horizon. In non-recession cases, meanwhile, the&nbsp;gain was a staggering 24% with particularly strong performance in the early, post-cut months. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 index also performed extremely well in non-recessionary cases, led by non-resource, pro-cyclical sectors such as information technology, communications, healthcare and industrials.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h5><strong>Sector breakdown: S&amp;P 500 performance in a non-recessionary environment following the start of a new rate-cutting cycle<\/strong><\/h5>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Sector-breakdown-e-01-1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Sector-breakdown-e-01-1.png 1000w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Sector-breakdown-e-01-1-300x240.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Sector-breakdown-e-01-1-768x615.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: Ned Davis Research<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly,\nbased on this analysis, the state of the underlying economy has the potential\nto play a very big role in the ongoing trajectory of stock prices once (and if)\nthe Fed starts lowering rates. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the\nmoment, imminent recession seems unlikely given the U.S. economy\u2019s solid\nemployment picture and still positive\u2014albeit slowing\u2014GDP growth.
