And just like previous crises, the fallout from the virus is a valuable reminder that dividend-paying stocks are not created equally and must be evaluated on their own merits.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To that end, there\u2019s no question that yields across the broad spectrum of dividend payers has become more attractive relative to 10-year government bond yields in recent weeks. In Canada and the U.S., this is true across most sectors and the average spread between the two yields recently reached all-time highs, based on our data since the Second World War. At the same time, many industries are now boasting average dividend yields near or at their historical highs on an absolute basis.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Canadian Dividend Yields: Today vs. History<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"451\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart01-en.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6556\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart01-en.png 1000w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart01-en-300x135.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart01-en-768x346.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\"><strong>Source: AGFiQ as of May 15, 2020<\/strong><\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>But higher yields are only part of the equation that makes up the current landscape for dividends. Also at play is a growing list of dividend suspensions and\/or cuts as companies batten down their hatches in hopes of minimizing the damage of the economic slowdown. In many cases, these actions are being taken to shore up already diminishing balance sheet strength or to pre-empt such deterioration from happening in the first place. Meanwhile, some companies are suspending or reducing their dividends on principle after having to furlough employees unable to work due to government shutdowns and social distancing measures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>U.S. Dividend Yields: Today vs. History<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart02-en.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6558\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart02-en.png 1000w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart02-en-300x150.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stephen-blog-dividends-chart02-en-768x384.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\"><strong>Source: AGFiQ as of May 15, 2020<\/strong><\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>Either way, this growing list highlights the value of analyzing dividend payers based not only on the size of their current yield, but also its sustainability over time. And while it\u2019s difficult to predict whether a company <em>chooses<\/em> to suspend or cut its dividend under extraordinary circumstances, it\u2019s possible to forecast which companies may be <em>forced<\/em> to make those same decisions. For example, those with low debt-to-equity and high cash-to-asset ratios are more likely to support their dividends than those without. The same goes for payers that have historically high return-on-equity (ROE) and low payout ratios.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping close tabs on these factors\u2014along with others such as high free cash flow yield and high free cash flow margin\u2014should be nothing new to seasoned dividend investors, but doing so rigorously has not been this critical since the Great Financial Crisis more than a decade ago. After all, the opportunity set for dividends may never be more attractive than it is now, but it also may never be more precarious.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Stephen Duench&nbsp;is a Vice President and Portfolio Manager at AGF Investments Inc.
