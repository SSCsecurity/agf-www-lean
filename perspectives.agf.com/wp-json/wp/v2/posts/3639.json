Despite the word\u2019s removal, the Fed has not signalled a change in the rate path, he added, while also stating that monetary policy is still accommodative given where current interest rates lie.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, it\u2019s true that not much has changed regarding the Fed\u2019s dot path of implied interest rates in 2019 and 2020. It continues to forecast three 25 basis point hikes next year and one more of 25 basis points the following year. Moreover, no rate hike is currently forecast for 2021 despite a wide range of projections that demonstrate the considerable uncertainty that Fed members face longer term.<\/p>\n<p>Powell said the Fed is \u201ctrying to balance between moving too fast and slow.\u201d but would also adjust its policy if necessary in the future. This includes a change in the path of inflation, which seems \u201cto be fairly nonreactive\u201d to economic slack at the moment, as well as a weakening economy. Interestingly, the central bank would also \u201creact to a significant, lasting market correction.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For now, however, the Fed continues to be on a gradual hiking path despite the U.S. economy\u2019s stronger than expected growth this year. And while U.S. President Trump expresses his disdain about another rate hike, investors should feel relatively good about the central bank\u2019s measured&nbsp;approach.<\/p>\n<p><em>Tom Nakamura is vice president, currency management &amp; strategy at AGF Investments Inc.
