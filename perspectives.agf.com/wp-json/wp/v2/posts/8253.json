Is there more to it than perhaps meets the eye? &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you look at major equity indexes like the S&amp;P 500 or S&amp;P\/TSX Composite Index in Canada, the past month or so have been marked by a couple of minor pullbacks and then small subsequent surges that have added up to almost nothing in terms of gains or losses. In fact, after rising a little more than 5% in April, according to Bloomberg, the tremendous rally in U.S. stocks since markets bottomed over a year ago seems to have stalled for now \u2013 at least in the aggregate. But if you look at the market across its entirety, there\u2019s been much more volatility to contend with than what is suggested by these few broad-based equity benchmarks. And there have been some very big corrections as well. Take Bitcoin, for example. The \u201cKleenex\u201d of crypto currencies has been one of the most impressive speculative trades since the pandemic hit, but it is down more than 30% since the beginning of May, Bloomberg data shows. Meanwhile, several Special Purpose Acquisition Companies, or SPACs for short, are down almost as much or more over the same period \u2013 again after being driven higher in the preceding months on a good deal of speculation. Of course, the same goes for some of the frothier tech stocks whose profitability and ability to deliver sustainable cash flow growth is well into the future. They\u2019ve pulled back significantly under the threat of higher inflation (and higher interest rates) while, on the flipside, some of the more cyclical parts of the market continue to run up as the recovery takes further hold.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What does this undercurrent say about the psyche of markets?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It suggests that caution is starting to take precedent over exuberance, but that\u2019s not a slight to the confidence of investors, nor is it to say equity markets can\u2019t continue to climb from here. If anything, it\u2019s encouraging to see less froth in the market \u2013 even if the short-term pain of it can be tough to swallow \u2013 because it likely reflects a more reasoned approach to markets is coming to the fore while the more speculative nature of markets that has been evident in recent months is starting to wane. Remember, markets have rallied off the bottom in large part because of tremendously stimulative monetary and fiscal policy that has almost acted like a free pass for investors to take on excessive risk whatever their poison. But investors can no longer count on \u201cmore of the same\u201d from governments and central banks now that the economy is beginning to normalize from an abnormal state of being. In the U.S., for instance, President Biden\u2019s new infrastructure bill has been heavily scrutinized (if not outright criticized) in Congress over the past couple of weeks and if a deal actually ends up being reached, the US$1-trillion amount that still seems to be on the table pales in comparison to the original proposal worth US$2.25 trillion over eight years. More importantly, all eyes are on the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s next moves as it contemplates the risks of higher inflation and what to do if wages continue to rise and recent price increases for food and other goods including lumber and copper aren\u2019t as transitory as the Fed expects. For now, it\u2019s holding the line by saying it has no plans to raise rates \u2013 at least until 2023 \u2013 but that could change and, regardless, it will likely start tapering its latest quantitative easing program well before then, if not sometime as soon as this fall. In other words, we\u2019re now entering a much less accommodative environment at a time when it\u2019s still very difficult to forecast what the new normal for the economy is going to be. It may be months before we figure that out and it\u2019s because of that uncertainty that more emphasis will likely need to be placed on those basic principles of investing that have been somewhat forgotten of late in favour of heightened speculation. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Given all of this, how might investors position their portfolios in this environment?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a strong argument to be made in this environment \u2013 and most others, frankly \u2013 for the use of a barbell approach that emphasizes quality stocks, but also doesn\u2019t overly discriminate between growth or value or some other theme at the expense of proper diversification. That doesn\u2019t mean investors shouldn\u2019t be tactical. It may still be prudent to overweight cyclical areas of the market right now, but this trade has already run pretty hot this year, so investors need to be careful about chasing returns that have already been realized instead of trying to earn what comes next through a careful analysis of current valuations and the fundamentals of individual companies. And, then, from a broader asset allocation standpoint, perhaps the biggest question facing investors is what to do about their fixed income portfolio and more specifically government bonds that are susceptible to rising interest rates. The answer, at least in part, is to be diversified across a wider spectrum of fixed income assets, including those that are less rate sensitive such as high-yield credit. In addition, alternative asset classes and strategies \u2013 from private credit to equity hedges \u2013 are only becoming more important in the grand scheme of things as a potential means to higher income and lower volatility. Of course, knowing the right mix will largely depend on individual circumstances and objectives, but not exploring these options could leave investors short of their goal whatever that may be.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kevin McCreadie is Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at AGF Management Limited.
