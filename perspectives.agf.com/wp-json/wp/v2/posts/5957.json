In their own words, here\u2019s what they would recommend this holiday season. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Judy Goldring, President and Chief Administration Officer, AGF Management Limited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently watched a (short) Netflix series called:&nbsp;<strong><a aria-label=\" (opens in a new tab)\" href=\"https:\/\/www.netflix.com\/ca\/title\/80184771\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Inside Bill\u2019s Mind:&nbsp; Decoding Bill Gates<\/a><\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was interested in watching it because Bill Gates has always fascinated me and I wondered what he was like as a person and what makes him tick. I also thought I might learn something. It is also a short, three-episode series so it was quick and easy to consume. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was most interesting to me was how he thinks so big, and on such a scale that it is really so impressive. In each episode, they speak about three large initiatives that he has undertaken whether it be the eradication of polio around the world, the improvement in sanitation for over four billion people, or how to produce clean nuclear energy that will solve the world\u2019s energy demand and reliance on oil.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In each episode, you learn more about Bill, his genius, his humanity, and his brain. He is truly a genius and it is fascinating to see how he thinks. One great takeaway was just the sheer volume of reading he does. While I won\u2019t match that ever, it was an important learning to read more.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was really quite inspirational as well to see how he is spending his wealth on looking to truly improve the planet and the enhance humanity\u2019s role on earth. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chris Jackson, Chief Operating Officer, AGF Management Limited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019ve just finished Season Four of the Malcolm Gladwell\npodcast <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/revisionisthistory.com\/\">Revisionist History<\/a><\/strong>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really enjoy his analytical \u201cre-look\u201d at events from the past and his ability to present a different perspective than what the headlines may have portrayed. I also enjoy his quirky sense of humour. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mark Adams, Senior Vice-President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary, AGF Management Limited<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have become a big fan of podcasts in the last few years. They are so accessible and fit in with my busy lifestyle. I listen to them during a workout, while commuting or carpooling with my kids. Here are some of my current favourites: <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/ca\/podcast\/invest-like-the-best\/id1154105909\">Invest Like the Best<\/a><\/strong>: This podcast is about smart people sharing great ideas and their experience in business and investing.
