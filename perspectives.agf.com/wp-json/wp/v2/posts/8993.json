Today\u2019s focus is the synchronous underperformance of growth and momentum stocks<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It may not be today or tomorrow or the day after that, but sooner or later, most investors will recognize this year\u2019s selloff in equity markets as an opportunity to buy some good stocks at discounted prices. In doing so, their instinct might be to seek out the hardest hit names of the recent correction, yet that might not be the best approach \u2013 at least from a factor perspective.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a case in point, AGFiQ\u2019s research shows that some of the worst performing equities of late are those that are characterized by one of either two factors: growth and momentum. For example, companies with <em>high sales growth<\/em>, one of the primary metrics that help define a growth stock, have underperformed the broader market by as much as 11.5% since the beginning of 2022, while companies that are <em>long-term winners,<\/em> a popular gauge of momentum stocks, have underperformed by 12%.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Synchronized Underperformance of Growth and Momentum Stocks<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"525\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stock-rise-and-fall-02-10-22-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8994\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stock-rise-and-fall-02-10-22-01.png 1000w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stock-rise-and-fall-02-10-22-01-300x158.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/stock-rise-and-fall-02-10-22-01-768x403.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Caption\"><em>Source: AGFiQ with data from FactSet as of February 2, 2022.

Of course, that kind of advantage isn\u2019t always fairly rewarded by investors, but it\u2019s much more likely to be the case in a slower growth, rising rate environment like today, which usually benefits quality companies that have clean balance sheets, ample free cash flow and strong profitability profiles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, whether it\u2019s <em>high sales growth<\/em> versus <em>long-term winners<\/em> or some other examples of synchronized underperformance of factors or sub-factors, the decision to buy into the market following a correction shouldn\u2019t be based on how much a stock has dropped in price but on how much it might rise based on its current valuation in relation to the market and the underlying fundamentals of the company.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"show-Canada\">Click to learn more about our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/capabilities\/quantitative\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quantitative capabilities<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/capabilities\/quantitative\/index.jsp\">.<\/a> &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"show-institutional\">Click to learn more about our&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/institutional\/strategies\/quantitative\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\">Quantitative capabilities<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/capabilities\/quantitative\/index.jsp\">.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"show-us\">Click to learn more about our&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/us\/quantitative\/index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Quantitative capabilities<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/ca\/en\/capabilities\/quantitative\/index.jsp\">.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The views expressed in this blog are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of AGF, its subsidiaries or any of its affiliated companies, funds, or investment strategies.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">&gt;The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of February 8, 2022 and are not intended to be comprehensive investment advice applicable to the circumstances of the individual.
