What\u2019s next?"},"content":{"rendered":"\n<p>After months of optimism, trade tensions have reached a new intensity, with U.S. President Trump launching further trade actions, most notably against China, Mexico and India.&nbsp; In fact, no country appears immune to the tariffs and bans, marking a pivotal shift in U.S. policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These recent moves not only highlight the increasing weaponization\nof trade by the U.S. government, but raise the spectre of increasing headwinds to\nsentiment, global trade, economic growth and financial markets\u2014if not a global\nrecession.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, we still believe that while ideological tensions are\nlikely to persist between the U.S. and China, a trade agreement can be reached.\nHowever, with so much at stake, China will not capitulate to just any deal. It\nwill truly have to be one which meets the needs of both countries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>U.S.-China tensions\nturn from trade to technology war <\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The tone in China turned increasingly negative following President\nTrump\u2019s executive order last month banning U.S. companies from using\ninformation and communications technology from organizations considered to be a\nnational security threat. Immediately, the U.S. Department of Commerce added Huawei\nTechnologies Co. Ltd. To its \u2018Entity List\u2019, effectively barring it from buying\nthe components from U.S. companies without U.S. government approval\u2014an act\nChina saw as a direct form of aggression towards their \u2018national champion\u2019 tech\ncompany and dominant player in 5G technology.<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our view, this sharp pivot to turn tensions from a trade war\ninto a technology war is based on a vast overestimation of China\u2019s\ntechnological capabilities. Indeed, while China is quickly moving up the value\nchain, it still undergoing a significant change as it moves from an emerging market\nto a developed economy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in response to the U.S. government\u2019s actions, China\nretaliated by creating the \u2018Unreliable Entity List,\u2019 a directory which will\ninclude foreign companies, individuals and organizations that break commercial\ncontracts and stop supplying Chinese firms. However, so far, China\u2019s overall\nresponse has been measured. In a new white paper formally outlining its\nposition, China stressed the importance of cooperation between the two nations\nas the only path towards a better future. <a href=\"#_ftn2\">[2]<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>Up next? President\nTrump targets Mexico and India<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Just as the White House was making headway with its push to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), President Trump announced he would impose a 5% tariff on all imported goods from Mexico and would continue to increase tariffs each month until they reach 25% if the border crisis persists, effective June 10<sup>th<\/sup>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, three days shy of the deadline, the President\nannounced the two countries had reached an agreement and that the tariffs would\nthereby be \u201cindefinitely suspended.\u201d As part of the deal, Mexico has pledged to\ndeploy its National Guard throughout Mexico while prioritizing its southern\nborder with Guatemala. Mexico also agreed to expand its program to allow\nasylum-seekers to remain in Mexico while their legal cases are underway. Still,\nwhile the deal offers few new solutions to stem the flow of migrants, and some\nsuggest that Mexico had already agreed to such border actions months before\nTrump\u2019s tariff threat, it was enough for Trump to claim a political win. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, President Trump weaponized trade once again by terminating\nIndia\u2019s designation as a developing nation. This ended years of preferential\ntreatment allowing the country to export approximately 2,000 products into the\nU.S. duty-free, including auto components and textile materials. Still, we\nbelieve the impact on India\u2018s economy is fairly immaterial given that exporters\nwere deriving duty-free benefits on US$190 million of the total US$5.6 billion\nworth of items traded.<a href=\"#_ftn3\">[3]<\/a> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4><strong>What\u2019s next?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>While we continue to believe that a trade agreement can be\nreached between the U.S. and China, the ongoing ideological tensions between\nthe two countries will likely continue to persist if history is any indication.\nIf there is one thing we have grown accustomed to under President Trump\u2019s\npresidency, it is the unpredictability and velocity with which things can\nchange. Last year, a similar ban to Huawei on the Chinese telecom equipment\nmaker ZTE Corp. was resolved sooner than later. However, any deal China would accept\nwould have to be based on mutual respect and cooperation. And China has made it\nclear that it will not compromise on major principles. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, China will likely continue to stimulate its\neconomy, just as it did following the U.S. tariff increase by cutting the reserve\nrequirement for small and medium-sized banks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, rising trade uncertainty points to increased global economic and market risks. Should President Trump continue to push his trade agenda forward by imposing further tariffs\u2014the global economy could be pushed into recession. Of course, a trade settlement could prevent such a negative outcome.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em><br>Regina Chi is Vice-President and Portfolio Manager at AGF Investments Inc.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]<\/a> Dell&#8217;Oro Group, April 3, 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref2\">[2]<\/a> China&#8217;s State Council\nInformation Office: China&#8217;s Position on the Economic and Trade Consultations,\nJune 2, 2019.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref3\">[3]<\/a> Deutsche Bank, June 6, 2019<\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\">\n\n\n\n<p><h5><small>The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of June 10, 2019 and should not be considered as personal investment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and \/ or sell securities.
