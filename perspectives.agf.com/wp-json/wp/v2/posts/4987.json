Its population of billionaires is the second largest\non the planet, having stockpiled fortunes in everything from tech and real\nestate, to cryptocurrency and potato chips.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, perhaps those like U.S. President\nDonald Trump can be forgiven for asking: Why is China still considered an\nemerging market or developing nation? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cChina, which is a great economic\npower \u2026 get(s) tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U.S.,\u201d\nTrump railed on Twitter in the early days of the trade war, pointing out the\ncountry\u2019s status as a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization\n(WTO). \u201cDoes anybody think this is fair?\u201d <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly Trump believes it is fair\ngame to challenge China\u2019s \u201cdeveloping\u201d designation within the WTO as\njustification for imposing new tariffs on everything from aluminum and steel,\nto washing machines and solar panels\u2014an ongoing trade war that may take longer than\nexpected to reach a truce after threats from Mr. Trump this week that he will\nboost tariffs to 25% from 10%.\nStill, the President isn\u2019t alone in questioning whether China\u2019s Developing\nNation categorization should be revisited in light of its ascent these past three\ndecades. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To some observers, China is a\nparadox, a country of some 1.4 billion people at the vanguard of innovation,\neven touted as the next Silicon Valley, where Gucci-loving shoppers promenade\nthe streets of cities like Shanghai and Shenzhen beneath gleaming skyscrapers.\nYet far from the boom of the country\u2019s coastal region, millions of impoverished\nfarmers work the fields, their homes carved into the mountainside. In other\nwords, it has become a country of haves and have-nots distinctly demarcated\nalong urban and rural lines. This growing wealth gap is highlighted by the fact\nthat 1% of the population controls nearly one-third of the country\u2019s total\nwealth, according to a 2015 Peking University report, entitled <em>China Family Panel Studies<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the country\u2019s emergence as\nthe world\u2019s second largest economy has been breathtaking. Indeed, it\u2019s come a\nlong way since it first initiated the process to join the WTO in which\ntwo-thirds of its members are classified as developing\u2014a definition that is self-determined.\nThis status has awarded developing countries \u201cspecial and differential\ntreatment,\u201d granting them more leeway in how they define free trade,\nderegulation and liberalization. And there\u2019s little question these allowances\nhave helped China scale quickly\u2014benefits it is loath to lose, especially its ability\nto implement agricultural subsidies and set higher barriers to market entry\nthan more developed economies. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Defining an emerging market<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All emerging markets or developing\nnations share a number of characteristics in their transition from agrarian and\nexport-based economies, including rapid rates of growth and industrialization.\nHowever, while WTO definitions of \u201cdeveloping\u201d and \u201cdeveloped\u201d are determined\nby countries themselves, others like the Morgan Stanley Capital International\n(MSCI) have defined a number of criteria for emerging markets which include\nmarket size, liquidity and accessibility. The latter includes considerations\nsuch as whether there are any restrictions on foreign ownership and the ease\nwith which investors can get their money into and out of a market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three of the world\u2019s top ten\neconomies are considered emerging markets, including China, Brazil and India,\nall with low levels of GDP per capita, or levels of personal income. China\u2019s\nGDP per capita, for example, is US$8,827 compared with US$59,532 in the United\nStates, according to the World Bank\u2019s 2017 figures. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>After last year\u2019s late slump, the economy is\npicking up steam <\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while China\u2019s economy slumped\nlate last year\u2014exacerbated by trade tensions\u2014first-quarter figures show a\nturnaround, buoyed by retail sales, exports and property investments. China\u2019s\neconomic growth held at 6.4% for the first three months of 2019, slightly below\n6.6% posted for all of 2018. Exports were notable in that they beat consensus\nestimates of 6.5% by a wide margin, rising 14.2%, after tumbling 20.7% in\nFebruary, according to Bloomberg\u2019s figures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, China has been outperforming\nall other emerging markets. It\u2019s still, by and large, a managed economy which\nthe government has been able to turn on and off through fiscal and monetary\npolicies. The trade talks certainly spooked some investors, but also created\nbuying opportunities. Getting to a final deal isn\u2019t going to be easy, but a\nresolution will undoubtedly ensure better bilateral trade with China agreeing\nto buy more U.S. goods, while opening up its economy to global companies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Looking ahead<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, there are more important reasons\nto be optimistic about China\u2019s future.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the government has introduced\nsome 70 stimulus measures, some of which took effect in the third-quarter of\n2018, and others which have been implemented this month. China continues to\ndeleverage the economy, slowing the rate of debt issued while lowering overall\ndebt. While construction and heavy industry drove China through much of its\nearlier growth stage, many of the current stimulus measures are based on\ndriving a service-based economy and increasing domestic demand, which already\naccounts for about 60% of China\u2019s economy, according to the China Council for\nthe Promotion of International Trade Academy. Cornerstone Macro, an investment\nresearch firm, estimates the aggregate effect of the stimulus measures to be at\nleast 1.6% of the country\u2019s GDP, with the International Monetary Fund pegging\nit as high 2%.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, China\u2019s stock markets are\nevolving from retail-based markets to more institutionalized ones. The\ninclusion of China A-shares on the MSCI last year helped kick-start this\ntransition. Traditionally, China A-shares, the stocks of Chinese-based\ncompanies traded exclusively on the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Shenzhen\nStock Exchange due to restrictions on foreign investment. Last year, the MSCI\nannounced it would quadruple the weighting of Chinese mainland shares in its\nglobal benchmarks from 5% to 20% in three stages, pumping billions of fresh\nforeign capital into the Chinese economy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For all of these reasons, investors should\ncontinue to watch China in 2019. After all, we\u2019d do well to remember what China\nhas achieved in just one generation\u2014evolving from the world\u2019s factory floor, producing\ncheap trinkets, into a technological powerhouse. What\u2019s next? At the very\nleast, a more developed market and more liberal economy. Certainly, growth will\nslow, but it will still be much faster than in developed markets such as the\nU.S. and Europe. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of May 06, 2019 and should not be considered as personal investment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
