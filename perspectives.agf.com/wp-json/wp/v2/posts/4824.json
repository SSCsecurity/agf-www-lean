But high yield also has the added benefit of maturing, an important factor in mitigating risk during bouts of heightened volatility.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dividend paying equities may carry a stable yield but have a continual value based on a stream of perpetual cash flows that may get discounted higher or lower through time, resulting in much higher volatility. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>High yield issues, by comparison, have a duration of three years on average, which implies that only six coupon payments are to be discounted back with a fixed maturity date. Combined with much higher compounded carry, this makes for a healthier way to generate alpha during times of elevated volatility. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be clear, high yield bonds cannot match dividend-paying equities in achieving outright returns. But in periods of heightened volatility, they offer excellent performance with much better downside protection. As such, equity investors who include high yield in their portfolio are left with a more efficient mix of holdings that can offer the highest expected return for the right level of risk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Andy Kochar is a Portfolio Manager and Head of Credit at AGF Investments Inc.
