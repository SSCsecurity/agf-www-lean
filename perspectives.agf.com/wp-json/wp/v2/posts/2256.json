But now that interest rates are on the rise and volatility is back, other style factors such as value, quality and size look poised to provide a greater share of gains going forward.<\/p>\n<p>This isn\u2019t to say these three factors have performed badly of late. In 2017, they each returned greater than 20%, according to MSCI data. Instead, it\u2019s more about the potential of some factors to outperform others in different periods of a market cycle.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>A decade of factor returns<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2257\" src=\"http:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/QUANT080_05-18_E_Factor_Jellybean_2008-2017.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"267\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/QUANT080_05-18_E_Factor_Jellybean_2008-2017.png 1080w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/QUANT080_05-18_E_Factor_Jellybean_2008-2017-300x74.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/QUANT080_05-18_E_Factor_Jellybean_2008-2017-768x190.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n<h5><strong>MSCI as of December 31<sup>st<\/sup>, 2017.

As rates rise, however, and the discount rate on earnings moves higher, these same investors are likely to forego premium valuations in favour of stocks that are less expensive.<\/p>\n<p>High quality companies that have strong balance sheets with stable earnings and low debt levels should benefit from rising rates as well. A more normalized credit cycle will be less forgiving, however, to highly levered companies who can no longer depend on near zero interest rates to bolster profitability.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also a growing expectation that the size factor will do relatively well in this changing rate environment as small capitalization stocks reassert their historical outperformance over larger cap names. This relationship has been flipped on its head at times during the long-running bull market because investors have been more inclined to buy up the market\u2019s biggest companies and keep a low risk profile.<\/p>\n<p>All things considered, investors can expect some changes in terms of those factors that will help drive performance over the next few years. This should prompt periodic portfolio adjustments, but doesn\u2019t mean loading up wholesale on one factor over others. A disciplined multi-factor approach that continually assesses the interplay between factors remains the best option to pursue.<\/p>\n<p><em>Mark Stacey* is a senior vice president, head of portfolio management &amp; co-chief investment officer at AGFIQ.<\/em><\/p>\n<h5><strong>*<\/strong><em><strong>A registered advising representative in Canada with Highstreet Asset Management Inc., a subsidiary of AGF Investments Inc.<\/strong><\/em><\/h5>\n<h5><strong>Commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of May 15, 2018 and should not be considered as personal investment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
