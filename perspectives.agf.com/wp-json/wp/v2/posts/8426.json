Today, nearly half (47%) of asset owners apply sustainability metrics to all their portfolios. And in five years\u2019 time, about two-thirds of asset owners expect to be employing sustainability metrics, including 40% who are planning to \u201cfully integrate\u201d sustainability criteria into their portfolios and investment processes.<sup>1<\/sup><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding expectations among institutions today can provide a valuable snapshot of what sustainable investing may look like in the future and in turn helps inform us here at AGF of the capabilities we need to continue to invest in to remain at the leading edge of sustainable investment offerings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an example, institutions looking to allocate to sustainable strategies are now digging deeper into asset managers\u2019 overall business practices and investment processes to separate true ESG commitment from \u201cgreenwashing\u201d. They are asking questions such as \u201cDoes the manager maintain its own internal ESG research capabilities and conduct proprietary ESG analysis?\u201d and \u201cHas the manager demonstrated a pattern of active ownership through proxy voting?\u201d This can provide an opportunity for asset managers to address these expectations by continuing to invest in evolving policies and processes including a focus on increasing measurement and reporting of specific outcomes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Interestingly, although nearly 90% of asset owners believe climate change will have a meaningful impact on their portfolios, fewer than half of institutions are actively working to manage climate risks.<sup>1<\/sup> Allocations to thematic strategies, an approach that invests in sustainable businesses that are related to and likely to benefit from specific impact themes such as energy efficiency and clean fuels, can be an effective way at generating impact in these critical areas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the study revealed that increasing numbers of institutions have started to incorporate allocations to sustainable thematic investment strategies given their potential to enhance impact levels, diversify portfolios and provide an additional source of alpha generation. 33% of respondents stating thematic strategies provide greater impact than ESG integration approaches and 22% believe these strategies can identify investment trends earlier than other approaches.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s encouraging to see the increased appetite for thematic strategies as we continue to invest in, and further build out, our sustainable investment platform which currently includes global equity and balanced strategies. AGF has been a long believer, three decades in fact, that exposure to thematic opportunities arising from the ongoing transition to a sustainable economy can result in a positive environmental and societal impact alongside the potential for attractive returns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Coalition Greenwich for the terrific partnership and to the institutions that took the time to share their valuable insights.
