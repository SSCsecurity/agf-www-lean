It\u2019s encouraging to see that Canadian investors want to know more about options for investing in companies committed to improving returns for shareholders and society at large.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, only 26% of survey respondents indicated they currently own responsible investments and only 23% have been asked by their financial services provider if they are interested in such options.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the overwhelming majority of investors (79%) are looking to their financial services provider to inform them of responsible investment options, there\u2019s an opportunity for advisors and their firms to do more to highlight investment options that align with their clients\u2019 values. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those most interested in responsible investing were young investors \u2013 those aged 18-34. Within this group, 36% reported owning responsible investments, compared to only 15% of respondents aged 55 or older. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of note, the survey also showed strong levels of concern about plastic pollution. Indeed, more than four-in-five respondents (82%) said they believe it is important for companies in their investment portfolio to reduce plastic waste, while 75% indicated they\u2019d like to invest in solutions to reduce plastic waste. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seven-in-ten investors believe companies that take steps to reduce plastic waste from their products and\/or packaging will be better long-term investments, while 58% believe companies continuing to rely on single-use plastics in their products and\/or packaging will suffer from a reputational perspective, perhaps making them less attractive investment targets.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the linkage between specific environmental issues such as plastic waste and business risks becomes better understood, investors are looking for real opportunities to connect their interest in improving environmental outcomes with returns. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At AGF, we remain committed to offering investment options that align with investors\u2019 responsible, sustainable and ESG investing preferences and provide them with those opportunities.
