This has had a chilling impact on Russian soldiers, who were told that they would be greeted as heroes.<\/p>\n<p>RUSSIAN CONVOYS headed for Kyiv today appear to have stalled, as a lack of food and fuel persists. As Ukrainian resistance surges, bodies of slain Russians lie<br \/>\nabandoned, the Times reports. There are credible reports that some troops have laid down their weapons and surrendered.<\/p>\n<p>EVEN IF RUSSIAN TANKS ENTER KYIV soon, what will happen when the occupants leave their vehicles? They will face a furious guerrilla war; the well-armed Ukrainians know the alleys and neighborhoods of Kyiv, and will contest every block.<\/p>\n<p>AS THOUSANDS OF RUSSIAN CORPSES AND WOUNDED return to Moscow and other cities, protests are certain to increase. Putin&#8217;s ludicrous claim that his troops are conducting a limited military operation may persist in the state-owned press, but very few Russians get their information from that source; they know what&#8217;s happening via the internet.<\/p>\n<p>RUSSIAN ATHLETES &#8212; hockey and tennis and soccer stars in the West &#8212; have enormous respect from Russian fans, and these celebrities will tell friends and family back home that their country has become a global pariah, concealing the extent of war crimes and fatalities.<\/p>\n<p>SO PUTIN NOW FACES GROWING DISSENT as a near-certain economic Depression looms in Russia, with thousands of funerals in coming weeks as his troops bog down in Ukraine. Putin is losing this war; many of the oligarchs and generals and sports stars know this &#8212; and they&#8217;re about to become a major wild card in this grim narrative.<br \/>\n*    *    *   *   *<br \/>\nSTATE OF THE UNION: These annual affairs are usually forgotten within days, but Joe Biden&#8217;s call for unity on Ukraine may resonate for weeks; it&#8217;s a rare issue that has united the nation.<\/p>\n<p>OTHERWISE, IT WAS AN ADEQUATE SPEECH, well delivered and quite newsworthy: Build Back Better has stalled; we&#8217;ve turned the corner on Covid; the progressive agenda was barely mentioned; there&#8217;s no quick cure for inflation; defund the police is totally dead; the Jan. 6 riot has faded as an issue; Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds offered a preview of the GOP&#8217;s election messaging, potentially<br \/>\ndevastating for Democrats.<\/p>\n<p>A HUGE PERCENTAGE of the politicians &#8212; and ordinary voters &#8212; are outraged; they want to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians in Ukraine. Biden wisely led his<br \/>\nspeech with this issue, knowing that Americans want him to do more to challenge the war criminal Putin.<\/p>\n<p>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"Fineprint\"> \n\tThe views expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of AGF, its subsidiaries or any of its affiliated companies, funds or investment strategies.\n\t<br\/><br\/>\n\tThe views expressed in this blog are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of the date of publication and should not be considered as personal \tinvestment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
