The health and well-being of our families, friends, colleagues, clients and communities is \u2013 and will remain \u2013 our primary concern. But their financial well-being is not something to lose sight of.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, a concerted effort on the part of central banks and governments across the globe is underway to stabilize our financial footing as we work collectively to overcome the greatest public health issue of our time. The private sector is playing its part too, and AGF is proud to join Canadian business leaders in signing an open letter by the Business Council of Canada calling for \u2018one focus\u2019 to help stop the coronavirus.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the uncertainty of our current situation and its implications for Canadians\u2019 financial health is weighing hard on us all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To their credit, Canada\u2019s federal and provincial governments are taking action to help maintain Canadians&#8217; financial well-being. In recent days, we\u2019ve heard commitments from all levels of government to support small businesses and other groups, providing relief to help them survive this difficult time. We\u2019ve also heard commitments of fiscal stimulus to help the broader economy stem the tide.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These commitments are encouraging, to be sure, but we know through experience that weathering the storm can be difficult, particularly in the thick fog of volatility. This is something financial advisors know all too well. In fact, it\u2019s times like these that advisors demonstrate their greatest value, serving as a steady navigator keeping clients focused on their intended destination as they withstand the choppy waters. The key is effective two-way communication to ensure investors\u2019 focus remains on the long-term.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, it\u2019s turbulent times like these that highlight the importance of a disciplined investment approach. There\u2019s no place for panic in portfolios. At AGF, our Investment Management team is defined by its disciplined approach and is working hard to offer the best possible stewardship of the investments our clients have entrusted to our care.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that we can\u2019t allow volatility to hinder our success so we remain focused on our investment objectives, delivering consistent results and providing the stability our investors seek regardless of tomorrow\u2019s unknowns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our clients and partners depend on us for business continuity \u2013 and we must be there to help them during unpredictable times. In order to ensure we can maintain business operations while protecting the health and safety of our employees, clients and communities, we have taken a series of specific steps which are outlined <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agf.com\/agf-files\/en\/agf_preparedness_march13_2020.pdf\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>It remains to be seen how long it will take to overcome the current public health crisis and related economic and market downturn. But the financial health of Canadians is not an afterthought and important steps in support of it are being taken. If history is any indication, this, too, shall pass \u2013 and that\u2019s the most important thing to keep in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of March 18, 2020 and should not be considered as investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy and\/or sell securities.
