The unemployment\nrate fell to 3.5% from 3.7% last month, marking its lowest level in 50 years,\naccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.&nbsp; While jobs data is typically considered a\nlagging economic indicator, the numbers, which included a decrease of 275,000 in\nthe number of unemployed, gave equity prices a temporary boost when they were\nreleased and suggests the U.S. economy still has life to it. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same, however, can\u2019t be said of the most recent Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) survey, which showed the U.S. manufacturing sector falling deeper into contraction. Since November, the country\u2019s PMI score has fallen from a high near 59.3, representing strong expansion, to 47.8 in September, according to the Institute of Supply Management (ISM).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1200\" height=\"519\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/US-PMI-e-01.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5608\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/US-PMI-e-01.png 1200w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/US-PMI-e-01-300x130.png 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/US-PMI-e-01-768x332.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\"> Source: Institute of Supply Management (ISM). Purchaser Managers Index surveys are completed monthly with a score of 50 or greater representing a manufacturing sector expansion and a score below 50 representing a contraction.<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>The most recent data has likely been distorted by a number\nof factors including the General Motors strike, which forced the automaker to\nstockpile inventory in advance, and the grounding of Boeing 737 Max planes that\nhas resulted in a significant reduction to shipments at least until the first\nquarter of next year, the company says. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it\u2019s clear that the toxic global trade\nenvironment is taking a toll. In addition to the headline PMI numbers, the\ndemand for trucking continues to fall and new export orders have fallen off a\ncliff, hitting their lowest level in several years, the ISM data shows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all of these mixed signals, it\u2019s no wonder that\nmarkets have been so volatile\u2014especially when considering that economic\nconditions are far worse in Europe where Brexit remains a major headwind and in\nother parts of the world. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then again, what has transpired so far this year shouldn\u2019t\ncome as a surprise. While it\u2019s inevitable, predicting the exact timing of a\nrecession is almost impossible and late cycle data has always tended to be\nconvoluted much like it is today. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recognizing that, investors who maintain a cautious stance may benefit more than those who are less risk averse. By holding a bit more cash in the portfolio, for instance, or hedging some equity risk with an allocation to alternative asset classes and\/or strategies, there may be a better chance of protecting against potential downside, while still being able to participate in future upside. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Kevin McCreadie is Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer at AGF Management Ltd.
