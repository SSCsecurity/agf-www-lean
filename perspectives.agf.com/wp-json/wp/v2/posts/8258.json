In the past, an Institute of Supply Management (ISM) reading of greater than 50<em> <strong>and rising<\/strong><\/em> has generally corresponded with a weakening U.S. dollar. But when readings are greater than 50<em> <strong>and falling<\/strong><\/em> as they have since peaking in March, there is an equally strong correlation to a rising U.S. dollar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Average Monthly Performance in Different ISM Regimes Since 1980<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-113\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-113 kelly-last-2\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">U.S. ISM cycle phase<\/th><th class=\"column-2\">ISM Rising\/Falling<\/th><th class=\"column-3\">U.S. Dollar Index<\/th><th class=\"column-4\">Canadian Dollar Index<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Positive Growth<br> (ISM>50)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">Rising<br \/>\n<\/td><td class=\"column-3\">-0.22%<\/td><td class=\"column-4\">0.14%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"><\/td><td class=\"column-2\">Falling<\/td><td class=\"column-3\">0.31%<\/td><td class=\"column-4\">-0.01%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Negative Growth<br> (ISM<50)<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">Rising<\/td><td class=\"column-3\">0.08%<\/td><td class=\"column-4\">-0.06%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\"><\/td><td class=\"column-2\">Falling<\/td><td class=\"column-3\">0.02%<\/td><td class=\"column-4\">-0.16%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<!-- #tablepress-113 from cache -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGF Investments Inc. based on information from Institute of Supply Management and Bloomberg LP.<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s still too early to know whether that relationship will hold true once again, it is not the only sign pointing to a potentially stronger greenback going forward. Just as important to the equation is the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s next few moves. As most investors are aware, the Fed has been extremely dovish in the wake of the pandemic, which has, no doubt, been a factor in the U.S. dollar\u2019s weakness, in part, because it no longer has a carry advantage over other currencies.&nbsp;(A carry trade occurs when traders buy currency pairs with high interest rate spreads, borrowing in low-rate currencies and investing in high-rate currencies.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the central bank\u2019s stance may not be so set in stone now that inflation expectations are starting to rise. While the Fed continues to believe the recent spate of higher prices is a transitory effect of the U.S. economic recovery, rather than one that is long-lasting, there remains a serious possibility that the Fed will refine its stance and become more hawkish about the need to tighten policy sooner rather than later. As such, even the slightest change in rhetoric from the Fed would likely be bullish for the U.S. dollar and presumably bearish for currencies like the Canadian dollar.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, even if these catalysts fall short of fruition, it\u2019s hard to see how the loonie continues to outpace the greenback, let alone keep up with it in the near term. At best, strong commodity prices and the Bank of Canada\u2019s decision to reduce asset purchases earlier than the Fed may continue to give a small lift to the Canadian dollar, but these factors have already largely been priced in. So too, more than likely, is the positive impact on the loonie of Canada\u2019s rosier outlook as a net exporter. While there\u2019s little question that the U.S. recovery has been a benefit to the Canadian dollar recently \u2013 as has the stimulative monetary and fiscal policies that have been enacted around the world \u2013 one reliable measure of valuation, terms of trade, is now at its highest level since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and suggests further gains in the loonie will be harder to come by.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><strong>Terms of Trade: Back to Post-GFC Highs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"350\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/terms-of-trade.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-8260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/terms-of-trade.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/terms-of-trade-300x105.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/terms-of-trade-768x269.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: Bloomberg LP as of June 2, 2021<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, this may be as good as it gets for the Canadian dollar \u2013 at least in relation to a U.S. counterpart that may be on the verge of a comeback.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tom Nakamura is Vice President and Portfolio Manager, Currency Strategy and Co-Head of Fixed Income at AGF Investments Inc.
