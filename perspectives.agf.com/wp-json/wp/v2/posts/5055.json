While high beta stocks have been outperforming low\nbeta stocks, high quality stocks (high ROE) have also been outperforming low\nquality stocks (low ROE) during this uptick.&nbsp;\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on AGFiQ data, S&amp;P 500 companies with an ROE\nranking in the top quintile have outperformed those in the bottom quintile by\nas much as 7% over the past three months. &nbsp;By historical standards, this outperformance\nis extreme. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the spread widens to levels such as today, however, it has almost always been followed by a period of weaker performance, whereby higher quality stocks (as defined by ROE) have not been rewarded nearly as much relative to lower quality stocks. In fact, there have been some instances, including early spring last year and in 2016, when higher quality stocks quickly reverted after a period of outperformance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, certain sectors may be more susceptible than others to a pullback.&nbsp; Almost 80% of the names in the top ROE quintile have been represented by just four sectors: &nbsp;Information technology, industrials, consumer discretionary and consumer staples.&nbsp; Of these sectors, the IT sector and Consumer Staples are most overrepresented in the top quintile.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Return on equity: S&amp;P 500 sectors with most top quintile stocks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-54\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-54\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Sector<\/th><th class=\"column-2\">% of stocks in quintile<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Information technology<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">25%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Industrials<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">22%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Consumer discretionary<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">19%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Consumer staples<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">13%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<!-- #tablepress-54 from cache -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGFiQ as of May 3, 2019<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>Real estate, energy, health care and financials have the highest percentage of stocks in the bottom quintile of return on equity with real estate and energy stocks most overrepresented in the bottom quintile. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3><br>Return on equity: S&amp;P 500 sectors with most bottom quintile stocks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-55\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-55\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">Sector<\/th><th class=\"column-2\">% of stocks in quintile<\/th>\n<\/tr>\n<\/thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Real estate<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">18%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Energy<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">15%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Healthcare<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">14%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Financials<\/td><td class=\"column-2\">14%<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n<!-- #tablepress-55 from cache -->\n\n\n\n<div class=\"Fineprint\">Source: AGFiQ as of May 3, 2019<\/div><br>\n\n\n\n<p>None of this is to suggest an imminent selloff in quality U.S. stocks is near, only that outperformance in recent months of companies with strong return on equity may not be as drastic going forward.
