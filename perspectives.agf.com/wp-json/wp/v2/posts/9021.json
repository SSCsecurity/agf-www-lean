Showers, not snow, are possible. If the late-winter &#8220;mud season&#8221; arrives earlier than usual, that would put pressure on Putin to move sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p>ANOTHER WILD CARD involves U.S. intelligence agencies. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and others have been unusually specific about Russian options &#8212; their use of &#8220;false flag&#8221; incidents as a pretext for an invasion, possible use of chemical weapons, and Russian cyber operations. It&#8217;s almost like the U.S. knows what the Russians are thinking.<\/p>\n<p>THE U.S. INTELLIGENCE INFORMATION has been so detailed that there&#8217;s a growing suspicion that America has planted listening devices in Moscow, or that there&#8217;s a well-placed &#8220;mole&#8221; in Putin&#8217;s inner circle. Maybe the mole is a double agent, but it&#8217;s possible that the U.S. has access to what Putin is thinking, which may explain the specificity of U.S. comments.<\/p>\n<p>WE THINK THE SHORT-TERM AMERICAN GOAL is simply to stretch out the negotiations, pushing the threat of war well into March. By then, Putin may grasp the obvious: an invasion of Ukraine would be a disastrous miscalculation, potentially producing thousands of casualties on both sides, with an enormous blow to Russia&#8217;s economy &#8212; and no clear end game. The West is firmly against him, a stronger show of unity than Putin expected.<br \/>\n*   *   *   *   *<br \/>\nBACK HOME, THE INEPT U.S. CONGRESS has passed still another budget extension ahead of tonight&#8217;s deadline, keeping the government open through March 11 as lawmakers debate amendments that may be attached to the bill. Spending thus will be stuck for a fifth month at fiscal 2021 levels, as the trend on fiscal policy veers away from massive new outlays.<\/p>\n<p>IF THERE&#8217;S A THEME IN CONGRESS in this new year, it&#8217;s the vulnerability that both parties face if anyone gets sick or worse. Instead of a 50-50 Senate tie, it&#8217;s now 50-49 in favor of the Republicans as long as Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) recovers from a stroke, unlikely to return until spring.<\/p>\n<p>THIS GIVES THE REPUBLICANS AN OPPORTUNITY to use quorum rules to block Biden Administration nominations. This already has delayed approval of five Federal Reserve nominees, probably for the next few weeks &#8212; or until the most controversial nominee, Sarah Bloom Raskin, pulls out and allows the other four to win confirmation.<\/p>\n<p>COULD THE REPUBLICANS employ a similar tactic to block President Biden&#8217;s upcoming Supreme Court nomination?  There should be fairly clear sailing for Michelle Childs of South Carolina, because she will win a handful of Republican votes.<\/p>\n<p>BUT IF THE NOMINEE is one of the more activist candidates, the Republicans might use quorum rules to block her, which would infuriate Democrats and make Congress even more divided and dysfunctional, if that&#8217;s possible.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"Fineprint\"> \n\tThe views expressed in this blog are those of the author and do not necessarily represent the opinions of AGF, its subsidiaries or any of its affiliated companies, funds or investment strategies.\n\t<br\/><br\/>\n\tThe views expressed in this blog are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of the date of publication and should not be considered as personal \tinvestment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
