The S&amp;P 500 has rallied after initial weakness and the S&amp;P\/TSX Composite index has made gains as well. Some of the harder hit stocks, meanwhile, have included industrial companies that are heavy users of steel and aluminium in their products.<\/p>\n<p>In our view, U.S. President Trump\u2019s administration may be using tariffs as a tactic to encourage progress in trade talks with its allies. As a result, we believe a NAFTA deal \u2013 though unlikely this year \u2013 remains a possibility despite the current stalemate in negotiations.<\/p>\n<p>Given this backdrop, investors should be prepared for more trade-related volatility on markets in the weeks ahead, but should also remember that strong economic conditions, unprecedented late-cycle fiscal stimulus and robust corporate earnings growth continue to be positive catalysts for stock prices.<\/p>\n<p>In these uncertain types of environments, an active approach that takes advantage of opportunities as they arise makes most sense.<\/p>\n<h5><strong>Commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of June 1, 2018 and should not be considered as personal investment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
