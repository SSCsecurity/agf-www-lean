This year, as with most years, analysts from AGF\u2019s equity research team attended the conference to gather key technology-related insights. In this piece, Auritro Kundu, AGF\u2019s technology analyst on the North American equity research team, summarizes his key takeaways.<\/p>\n<h3>NVIDIA one of the big winners of CES<\/h3>\n<p>NVIDIA won 20 awards ranging from their DRIVE automotive artificial intelligence (AI) platform to their Big Format Gaming Displays. NVIDIA kicked off CES by announcing partnerships with Volkswagen, Uber, Baidu and more, demonstrating the increasing importance of self-driving technologies. Overall, NVIDIA now has approximately 320 different automotive partners (Tier 1\u2019s, OEMs, startups), up from 250 partnerships a year ago. Volkswagen ID Buzz will use NVIDIA DRIVE IX technology and Uber has already begun using the technology in its first fleet of Volvo XC90 SUVs. NVIDIA also unveiled the Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC) for the AI car platform. Xavier can perform 30 trillion operations per second using only 30 watts of power. NVIDIA says that is 15 times more efficient than the previous architecture. Talks with management suggest that average selling prices (ASP) for NVIDIA could reach US$500-$1000 per car by 2025, with US$1000 implying Level 5 (fully autonomous) functionality. This compares to NVIDIA\u2019s current ASP per car of US$100-$120, which is for infotainment, and demonstrates the considerable growth opportunity for NVIDIA in the automotive industry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>NVIDIA Stock Price (LHS) and NVIDA Xavier Chip- 15x more efficient than previous architecture (RHS)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1409 size-full\" src=\"http:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1123\" height=\"435\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces1.jpg 1123w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces1-300x116.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces1-768x297.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1123px) 100vw, 1123px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Autonomous driving \u2013 there is room for multiple winners!<\/h3>\n<p>CES could change its name from the \u201cConsumer Electronic Show\u201d to the \u201cCar Electronic Show\u201d based on the amount of interest in autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars dominated the show in our view, as they took up all the parking lot real estate around the convention. In fact, the entire North Hall is dedicated to connected and self-driving car technologies. Aptiv, Intel, Renesas, BlackBerry, Toyota, Ford, Lyft and several other companies announced either self-driving fleets, partnerships with autonomous or ride sharing companies, or software used to power autonomous vehicles.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Renesas R-Car platform (photo on the left) and HAD solution kit (trunk \u2013 photo on the right)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1411 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1116\" height=\"275\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces2.jpg 1116w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces2-300x74.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces2-768x189.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1116px) 100vw, 1116px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>OLED TVs looked better than ever<\/h3>\n<p>CES &#8217;18 showcased new OLED TV models from LG, Sony, Changhong, Konka, Haier, and already released ones from Skyworth. OLED TVs looked better than ever featuring new image processors, improved colors, and increased sharpness and depth, in our view. 2018 models were more an iteration of 2017 with a focus on both Wallpaper TV sets as well as Crystal Sound TVs (the TVs have so-called exciters that are located behind their OLED panels that produce sound by vibrating the displays). LG Display demonstrated several new OLED TV\u2019s, including a 65\u201d Crystal Sound TV, an 88\u201d 8K TV display, a 65\u201d 4K roll able TV prototype, along with other OLED lighting concepts ranging from laptops, car dashboards and digital signage. Our view is that OLED is still in the early innings of adoption in smartphones, and that large screen TVs, automotive displays, gaming and digital signage offer upside over the long-term. Moreover, emerging technologies from key suppliers (such as Applied Materials and Universal Display) could bring OLED cost parity closer to LCD faster than believed, thus resulting in an inflection for OLED related products sooner rather than later.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LG Display rollable TV full-screen and rolled-up screen (left); LG\u2019s 8K OLED TV (right)<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-1412 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1084\" height=\"284\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces3.jpg 1084w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces3-300x79.jpg 300w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/ces3-768x201.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1084px) 100vw, 1084px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><\/h3>\n<h3>The rise of virtual assistants \u2013 Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant the next frontier of advertising<\/h3>\n<p>Alexa and Assistant were enabled in virtually every consumer device such as speakers, home theatres, TVs, refrigerators, washers, dryers and smoke alarms. Connecting these gadgets to much larger ecosystems, Amazon and Google have presented a vision in which voice commands are available pretty much anywhere and can control practically any device. After a few years away from CES, Google was seemingly everywhere. With e-commerce the core of Amazon\u2019s business, we believe Amazon is a clearer winner of the customer captivity of home assistant devices. Alexa could generate US$10 billion in revenue by 2020, according to RBC.<\/p>\n<p>In summary, CES\u201918 was one of the biggest yet, with over 180,000 attendees. The dominant themes of autonomous vehicles, virtual assistants, artificial intelligence, and OLED left us with continued strong conviction in the companies we own in these spaces, including Amazon, NVIDIA, Sony, LG Display, and Universal Display.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h5>The commentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information based on information available as of January 23, 2018 and should not be considered as personal investment advice or an offer or solicitation to buy and\/or sell securities.
