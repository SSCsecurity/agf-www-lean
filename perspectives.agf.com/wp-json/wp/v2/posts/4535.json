But in today\u2019s climate of\nweakening economic data, it\u2019s become highly debatable whether that means the\ncurrent tightening cycle is over or just on pause. &nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the\nFed\u2019s dot path of future rate hikes has been pared back in recent weeks, it\nstill calls for two increases this year. Financial markets, on the other hand,\nnow believe the Fed will remain on hold throughout 2019 and even predict a\npossible rate cut in 2020, according to Bloomberg data. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, something has to give \u2013 either a sizable downward revision from the Fed is necessary or the market will need to rein in its more pessimistic predictions. So, who\u2019s right? <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>History may provide some guidance on this front. Based on data going back 100 years, the last Fed hike of a tightening cycle is followed by a rate cut only eight months later, on average, with most instances occurring between three to six months after the final hike.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Last hikes, first cuts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"622\" height=\"542\" src=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/fed-rate-cuts-622x542.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-4536\" srcset=\"https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/fed-rate-cuts-622x542.png 622w, https:\/\/perspectives.agf.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/fed-rate-cuts-622x542-300x261.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" \/><figcaption>Source: Ned Davis Research, February 2019<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With the most\nrecent hike taking place in December 2018, that would suggest a rate cut coming\nsometime this summer, but this seems doubtful given macroeconomic and financial\nconditions are still relatively strong. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while some level of economic sputtering should be expected through the first half of 2019 \u2013 as the combined effects of the 2018 Fed hikes and the diminishing tax reform boost are absorbed in U.S. data \u2013 such periods of weak growth are nothing new and have been witnessed several times in the past decade.  <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result, the Fed may well return to hiking as its dot path implies, but one rate increase this year \u2013 not two \u2013  seems increasingly likely and only after a prolonged pause, which, according to history, would push out an eventual rate cut even further. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"\/>\n\n\n\n<h5><small>The\ncommentaries contained herein are provided as a general source of information\nbased on information available as of March 8, 2019 and should not be considered\nas investment advice or an offer or solicitations to buy and\/or sell\nsecurities.
